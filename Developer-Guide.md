# Developer Guide

This is the one guide for working on Thornswood. This page is its index: each task has a short page of its own in `docs\guide`, listed below in the order a first day reads them. A later day opens the page it needs, or finds a section by name in the table of contents. `CLAUDE.md` in the private ops repo adds only what applies to a Claude.

Each page's outline nests the same way: a page is a task, a section is a group inside it, and a subsection is a step.

- Repository: https://github.com/ThornswoodRP/Thornswood
- Board: https://github.com/orgs/ThornswoodRP/projects/1
- Site: https://thornswood.net
- Staff pages: https://thornswood.net/hub
- Long glossary: [docs/GLOSSARY.md](docs/GLOSSARY.md)

## The pages

Each page is one task. A first day reads them in this order; a later day opens the one it needs, or finds a section by name in the table of contents below. A citation names the page and the section, for example `docs/guide/rules.md, "Fix the cause, no band-aids"`.

| Page | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| [Set up a machine](docs/guide/set-up-a-machine.md) | A new PC from nothing to a clone that builds, and a PC that can sign and publish a release. |
| [Make a change](docs/guide/make-a-change.md) | One issue, one branch, one pull request: start from main, commit, open the pull request, merge it. |
| [The rules](docs/guide/rules.md) | What Thornswood is, the words, fixing the cause instead of a band-aid, and buttons instead of chat commands. |
| [The board, issues and test tasks](docs/guide/the-board.md) | Filing and ordering issues, how an issue and a comment are written, test tasks and known issues, and what is not a reason to skip one. |
| [Settled design, not up for a quiet rewrite](docs/guide/settled-design.md) | The design that stays unless the team agrees to change it. |
| [How work moves: the rules and the long form](docs/guide/how-work-moves.md) | Main, hotfixes and merging, branch names, dev first, signing, the build check and the six shared files, and the long form. |
| [Release to dev](docs/guide/release-to-dev.md) | Putting a change on the dev server and the dev launcher. |
| [Release to main](docs/guide/release-to-main.md) | Putting a release on the live server, a hotfix, and how a release goes out. |
| [After a pull request is merged](docs/guide/after-a-merge.md) | What runs after a merge, part by part. |
| [How the system fits together](docs/guide/the-system.md) | How the pieces fit together, and where things are written down. |
| [The tools, A to O](docs/guide/tools.md) | One letter per tool, from GitHub to the repository map: what it is, then the commands. |
| [Secrets, by name and place, never by value](docs/guide/secrets.md) | Every secret by name and where it lives, never its value. |
| [Staff commands](docs/guide/staff-commands.md) | The commands staff, testers and admins type in the game, and who may run each. |

## Glossary

The words this guide uses. The long alphabetical list, with file names, is [docs/GLOSSARY.md](docs/GLOSSARY.md).

| --- | --- |
| Repository | This project folder plus the history Git keeps for it |
| Clone | The copy of the repository on your PC |
| Commit | One saved step, with a message, on the branch you are on |
| Branch | A named line of commits. The folder shows one branch at a time |
| `main` | The shared branch. A live release is built from it |

| Push | Upload the branch you are on to GitHub |
| Pull | Download new commits from GitHub onto the branch you are on |
| Ship | The command that builds a release and publishes one channel |
| Channel | `dev` or main. Each channel has its own feed, server, and news |
| Dev build | The second launcher, `Thornswood-DevBuild`, used to try a release |
| Main build | The live launcher install |
| Feed | `version.json` for one channel. The launcher reads it from the site |
