# The installer

## What it is

What a new person runs before they have a launcher. Since issue #4824
(decided 27 October: "the installer is compiled code plus Velopack") it is two
parts, and neither is a script:

- **Velopack's Setup.exe** puts the launcher and Thornswood's own game files
  on the PC, under the person's own profile (`%LocalAppData%\Thornswood`),
  with no administrator prompt, and makes the desktop and Start menu
  shortcuts. `.github\workflows\merge-release.yml` packs it with `vpk`; issue
  #4825 says the rest of what Velopack carries.
- **The launcher's first start** is the install itself. With no install folder
  recorded yet, the launcher opens on its install window instead of its own
  (`launcher\app\InstallWindow.cs`), which asks what the old setup window
  asked, and then runs every step the old install script took, in compiled
  code (`launcher\app\InstallSteps.cs`), with the bar on the bytes copied and
  every line in the window and in `Profile\setup-log.txt`.

Until #4824, `setup\Bootstrap.cs` built `Thornswood-Setup.exe`, which
downloaded the payload from the site and ran the install script,
Setup-Thornswood, hidden in its window, and `Setup.bat` and `Install.bat` ran
the same script in a console. A hidden
script is what antivirus reads hardest, and the install was written in two
languages for one job, so the script, both batch files and the setup program
are gone, and nothing falls back to them.

This folder keeps `READ ME FIRST.txt`, the page a person reads, and
`licences\`, the GPL, AGPL and WebView2 texts handed over with the files
(#421; `licences\README.txt` says where each comes from).

## On your machine

The install runs inside the launcher, so it builds with the launcher
(`.\scripts\release\Build-Launcher.ps1`); this folder holds nothing to
compile. Nothing here is run from the checkout. To try a change, install from
a Velopack release on a machine that is not your own install, or start a built
launcher whose folder has no `install-root.txt` above it, which opens on the
install window. `tests\test-4824-install.py` builds the install steps with the
.NET SDK, runs them against stand-in folders, and holds the window to the
rules below.

## Where it runs

On the machine of anybody installing Thornswood for the first time, once:
Velopack's Setup.exe from the release, then the launcher's first start on that
machine. A launcher that finds its install folder recorded never shows the
install window again; a stopped install records nothing, so the next start
asks again.

## Why the install is in the launcher

One program and one install path. Velopack's Setup.exe has nothing to run but
the launcher it just put down, and the launcher already holds what the install
needs: how Steam and Skyrim are found (`Steam.cs`), what a Vortex folder must
hold (`OwnGame.PointAt`), and the agreement record (`Acceptance.cs`). A second
small program would have been one more exe to sign, update and keep in step
with all of that.

## Where it puts things

Velopack's folder holds the launcher. The install folder, Root, holds
`Profile`, `config.json` and, once the launcher makes it, `Game`, and it is
still the person's choice in the install window. The launcher records it in
`install-root.txt` beside Velopack's folder (`launcher\app\InstallPlace.cs`)
once the install has finished, so a stopped install is asked again on the next
start.

## Which drive it offers

The drive it starts on is the one Steam's copy of Skyrim Special Edition is on,
found the way the launcher finds it (`launcher\app\Steam.cs`: Steam's folder
from the registry, then every path in `config\libraryfolders.vdf`, then the
first library holding `steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\SkyrimSE.exe`).
`C:\Thornswood` is only the fallback when there is no Steam copy to find.

That is not a preference. Thornswood runs from its own game folder, built out
of the Steam copy mostly as hard links, and a hard link cannot cross a drive,
so an install on another drive is one the launcher refuses to play from
(`OwnGame.WhyNot`). The drive Skyrim is on is marked on its button, the line
under the buttons says what a different drive costs, and pressing Install on a
different drive asks once more before anything is written. It asks and does not
refuse: whether the launcher may fall back to copies instead is the team's call
(issue #473).

## Thornswood's own Skyrim folder

Issue #906, 28 September: "let's offer the own folder during install as
well". Under the drive card is a card with the words of the launcher's
Settings, Maintenance panel, a tick box, "Give Thornswood a Skyrim folder of
its own", and Choose Vortex's folder.

The install does not make the folder. The launcher does (`OwnGame.Make`), out
of what Vortex has deployed, and nothing is deployed while the install window
is up. So the tick answers the launcher's own question in advance: it goes into
`config.json` as `MakeOwnGame`, and the launcher then makes the folder without
asking once Vortex has deployed. Ticked, Thornswood's own files go into
`Profile\Payload` and nothing is written into the Steam copy (#1226); left
unticked, which is the default, they go into the Steam copy with a list of what
went there (`Profile\installed-into-game.txt`), and the launcher asks as it did
before. A chosen Vortex folder is checked the way `OwnGame.PointAt` checks it
(SkyrimSE.exe and `Data\vortex.deployment.json`) and saved as `VortexGame`, the
field the Settings button writes. A second install over a folder the launcher
already made writes Thornswood's files into it, separating any hard-linked name
first, and never parks it (#1233).

## What a person agrees to before Install

Issue #1009, asked for on 28 September: "check boxes that lock the install for
reading and accepting terms and conditions, privacy policy, and agreeing to
the rules", "and links to all 3". Beside Install are four boxes, all unticked:
the age box, then "I have read and accept the Terms and Conditions", "I have
read and accept the Privacy Policy" and "I have read and agree to the Rules".
Install stays greyed out until all four are ticked. Each of the three has a
link beside it that opens the page on the site in the browser
(`https://thornswood.net/terms`, `/privacy`, `/rules`), so what a person
reads is the current text, never a copy inside the launcher.

When Install is pressed, the install writes `Profile\accepted.json`: the time
in UTC, and for each page its address and the SHA-256 of its text as
`https://thornswood.net/api/page/<name>` serves it at that moment, which is the
version accepted. A page the site did not answer for is recorded with an empty
hash, and the install carries on: the boxes were ticked either way. Nothing
about the person or the machine goes in it. The steps then refuse to install
anything if that note is not there. The launcher reads the same file
(`launcher\app\Acceptance.cs`) on every start and asks again when it is missing
or a page changed.

## What the steps do

`InstallSteps.Run`, in order, each saying what it does in the window: Skyrim
still running is closed, asking before anything is ended
(`InstallSkyrim.cs`); the note of what was accepted; Skyrim found; which of
the three shapes this is (into the Steam copy, into `Profile\Payload`, or into
a folder the launcher already made), with an old `Game` folder parked as
`Game-old-<date>`; room on the drives (6 GB on the install folder's, 3 GB on
Skyrim's when the files go there); the files copied, stopping with both
folders named when one will not copy; the profile folders, the load order when
the package carries one, `applied.txt`, `SOURCE CODE.txt`, the licence texts;
`config.json` merged, never wiping a filled field with a blank one, and kept to
this Windows account; `Thornswood.lnk` in the install folder; and the checks at
the end, where the script extender and the address library are the
collection's to install next, and a wrong Skyrim build is the launcher's
Downgrade button's to fix.

The script's other shape, a copy of the whole base game for a payload built
with every mod in it, is not ported: no package carries that shape now, and
the launcher's own folder and its Downgrade card do that job.
