  test-chat-limit.js

  The To Do List, entry 149: "Chat is server-wide, unfiltered, has no rate
  limit anywhere". Every plain line went to every peer the moment it arrived,
  so one open console could fill every screen in the world.

  What it has to be done when, in the entry's own words: "a local harness
  connecting one socket and sending twenty chat lines in one second sees at
  most five broadcast and exactly one notice returned to the sender".

  This spawns the real voice-server.js in a scratch folder on a spare port,
  with its shipped numbers (five at once, one more every 1500ms), and drives
  it over two real WebSockets: one that floods and one that listens. Nothing
  here is a stand-in.

  And the part that is easy to get wrong while the limit still looks like it
  works: slash lines share this socket with the plugins' own reports, /chopped
  on every fall of the axe among them, so twenty of those sent by somebody who
  has just been slowed must all still reach the game server.

  Read only apart from its own temp folder.
