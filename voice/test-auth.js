/*
  Entry 6, step 6: drive the real voice service and assert what a join does.

  Runs the shipped voice-server.js in a scratch folder on a spare port, mints
  tokens through its own /token route, and joins over a real WebSocket. Nothing
  here is a stand-in but the site: the file under test is voice/voice-server.js,
  and a small site in this process answers /api/play/owns the way site/server.js
  does, so every answer it can give is driven.

  Since #1315 only a yes from the site mints a token: no answer, a 500, a body
  that is not JSON, a site that never answers and a service with no
  THORNSWOOD_SITE all get 503 and no token. Since #1303 a join that cannot
  prove itself is refused whatever THORNSWOOD_VOICE_AUTH says; the service
  here is started with it set to off to show it is not read.

  Since #1337 and #1322 the token goes with the handshake, as the second of
  the protocols offered after 'thornswood', and opens that one connection:
  without one the handshake is answered 403 and never becomes a socket, and
  a token that has opened a connection opens no other.
