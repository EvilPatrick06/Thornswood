// test-moved.js
//
// Issue #482: each person is sent only the positions of people near enough to
// hear, or in their party, and only when they changed.
//
// The cull (voice/test-cull.js) took the tick from every person's row to each
// person's view. That view was still sent whole five times a second whether
// anybody in it had moved or not, and most of an evening is people standing.
// Now the first tick after a join is the whole view, { t: 'pos' }, and after
// that { t: 'moved' } carries only rows that changed and the ids that left the
// view (gone), or nothing at all.
//
// This runs voice/voice-server.js in a temp folder on a spare port, feeds it
// two hundred people across ten cells, joins a real websocket for each, keeps
// each one's table the way the clients do, and counts every byte on the wire:
//
//   standing   nobody moves for three seconds
//   walking    forty of them walk, a step every 200 ms, for four seconds
//
// Before is what the tick sent until now: each person's whole view, every
// tick. It is worked out from the tables the sockets hold, which the checks
// below show are exactly the views. VOICE_SERVER points it at another copy of
// the service, which is how the numbers for the code before this were taken.
//
// Read only. Nothing outside the temp folder is touched.
