/*
  test-turn-key.js

  The TURN relay's key can sit in a file beside the voice service, and with no
  file nothing changes at all.

  From the To Do List, "Voice is a full peer-to-peer mesh with no relay and no
  cap, and the code already admits a pair that cannot connect is simply lost".
  Step one there is a relay, with its credentials minted by the service and
  the secret kept on the VPS, named by location only. The service could
  already make those credentials from THORNSWOOD_TURN_SECRET, but
  Install-Voice.ps1 puts the service's whole environment on the command line
  of the shell that starts it, so the only way in for the key was a place it
  could be read back out of. Now it can be turn-key.txt in the service's
  folder, the way token-key.txt already is.

  Nobody has stood up a relay, so what matters first is that this changes
  nothing while the file is not there. That is held here byte for byte: the
  /ice answer every page reads and its headers, the fields of /health, and the
  log, as the service wrote them before the file existed. The three pages each
  start from a list of their own and swap it for whatever /ice says, so the
  same answer means the same pages.

  Then the file itself: made into credentials the way coturn's REST scheme
  expects, read correctly whatever encoding a Windows box wrote it in, never
  logged, and beaten by the variable when both are set.

  Runs the real voice/voice-server.js in scratch folders on a spare
  port. Never connects to anything off this machine.
