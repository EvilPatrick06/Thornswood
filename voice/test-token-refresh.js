/*
  How the game's chat overlay gets and spends its join tokens (#1322, #1337).

  A token opens one connection and goes with the handshake, so the overlay
  spends each one on a single try: it offers it as the protocol after
  'thornswood' and never in the join message, does not offer it again, asks
  the front for a new one ('token? <profile>') when it has none, and goes at
  once when setToken hands one over. It used to keep one token for the
  session and present it on every reconnect, which is what made a copied
  token as good as the real one.

  Runs the shipped game/ui/thornswood-chat.js in a sandboxed `window`, with a
  fake WebSocket that records what it was offered and sent, and timers this
  file fires by hand. Nothing here is a stand-in for the file under test.
