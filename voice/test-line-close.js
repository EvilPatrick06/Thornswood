  test-line-close.js

  The line at the menu (#481), the relay's half. Patrick, 29 Sep: "they
  shouldn't need to check in while waiting in the queue ... just have it
  automatically lose a player's spot when they disconnect."

  The menu waits in line over its chat socket to this service. When the
  socket that said "/line" closes, and no other socket of the same profile is
  waiting, the game server has to hear of it at once: "/line gone" under that
  profile, marked relay, which nobody can send by typing it. And GET
  /commands carries this process's boot stamp, so the gamemode can tell a
  restart (whose sockets die without a word) and give every menu a minute to
  ask again.

  This spawns the real voice-server.js in a scratch folder on a spare port
  and drives it over real WebSockets, then restarts it. Nothing here is a
  stand-in.

  Read only apart from its own temp folder.
