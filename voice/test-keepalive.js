// Patrick, 23 September, with it on his screen while the service was up the
// whole time and the game noticed nothing: "Chat lost the server. Trying
// again." The service answered pings and never sent one, so a socket that
// said nothing for long enough was closed by what sits between the two ends,
// which is Caddy. Voice traffic kept a talking socket busy and the position
// feed kept a peer busy; the sockets that died were the quiet ones.
//
// This spawns the real service with a short ping interval, opens a real
// websocket, and waits for the ping frame to arrive. It is a raw socket
// rather than the WebSocket class on purpose: the class answers pings itself
// and never tells anybody, which is exactly what made this invisible.
