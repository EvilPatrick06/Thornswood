  test-local-chat.js

  Entry 150 on the To Do List: "Two people robbing a traveller on the Whiterun
  road are currently read by a smith in Markarth." Every plain line went to
  every socket on the server, /ooc was the only local line, and there was no
  /me.

  The fix is behind THORNSWOOD_CHAT_RANGE. Left unset it is off, which is
  how the live voice service is left. The dev voice service is installed
  with it on. This proves both halves against the real service:

    OFF. A plain line still reaches every socket in the box. The line
    above the head is local either way. /me, /s, /w and /ooc are local
    speech, not commands for the game server.

    ON. The entry's own test: three sockets, positions posted to /positions
    with two close together in one cell and one far off, one plain line from
    the first, and exactly two sockets receive it. Then the rest of what the
    setting promises: a shout carries further, a whisper less, a different
    cell at arm's length hears nothing, /me and /do arrive as actions, /ooc
    is local too, /roll still goes to the game server, somebody with no position reaches
    nobody and is told why, and a stopped position feed falls back to
    everybody rather than silencing the server.

  It also draws each kind through the chat page's own partsFor, and checks
  that a line with no kind is drawn exactly as the page always drew it.

  Runs voice-server.js from a scratch folder on a free loopback port, with its
  chat log in that folder. Never connects to anything else.

  VOICE_SERVER and CHAT_PAGE point it at other copies of the two files, which
  is how it was run against the code before the change to see it fail.
