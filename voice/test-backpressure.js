// test-backpressure.js
//
// One connection that stops reading used to grow the voice service's memory
// without limit.
//
// To Do List entry 284: "Check the write return and skip the tick for a
// backed-up socket, or keep a small bounded queue per connection and drop the
// oldest. For state that is superseded every tick, dropping is the correct
// answer and is what unreliable transport means."
//
// Every message went through Sock.send, which called socket.write and threw
// away the boolean it returns. When somebody's link cannot keep up, or their
// machine stops reading, node does not refuse the write: it keeps the bytes in
// memory and says false, and nothing here was listening. Measured on 24
// September with a copy of the service on loopback and one websocket that
// joined and never read, at 1,500 rows: once the loopback buffers were full,
// writableLength climbed by about 0.75 MB a second for as long as it ran
// (15 MB after 20 s) and RSS went from 58 to 87 MB. This harness, run against
// that code, saw the queue go from 0.85 MB to 4.4 or 4.55 MB in five
// seconds, the memory the service held grow by 3 to 4 MB, and a second stuck
// socket reach about 25.8 MB without ever being closed: 11 of 17 checks
// fail. With the fix the queue sits at 0.14 MB, one position message, and
// does not move.
//
// The roster checks came in when this met the culling work (entry 282). Its
// test-cull.js joins two hundred sockets at once, every join sends the whole
// roster to everybody, and the 1 MB ceiling closed up to 42 of them in one
// run. Against main's code on 24 September (cull-1-command-ack-1) this
// harness failed 15 of its 24 checks. With only the roster put back on the
// reliable send, 4 fail: sixty joins and leaves put 0.35 MB more behind the
// stuck socket, and 120 rosters reached it when it read again.
//
// This spawns the real service in a temp folder on a spare port, loopback
// only, with a small probe preloaded into it. The probe wraps socket.write
// from the inside and prints the largest queue and the memory in use four
// times a second, so the measurement does not depend on anything the service
// chooses to report about itself.
//
// Read only. Nothing outside the temp folder is touched.

    working through the frames that arrived in the same read. Found in review

    log as profile 0 with no name, so the moderators could not say who sent
    it. Twelve lines got out that way past the five the limit allows, and the
    slash commands among them were queued as nobody's.

    So this one sends itself offers until its own queue passes the ceiling,
    each followed by a chat line and a slash command, all in one write so
    they land in the same reads at the other end. A lot of it, because the
