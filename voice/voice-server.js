  Thornswood proximity voice, server side.

  Runs next to the SkyMP server. Two jobs and nothing else:

    1. Take position snapshots from the gamemode over plain HTTP on loopback,
       and tell each person connected where the people they could hear are.
    2. Relay WebRTC signalling between people so their browsers can talk to
       each other directly. The audio never comes through here.

  Deliberately dependency free, including the WebSocket implementation below.
  The VPS gets a zip and a node binary and nothing else: an npm install up
  there is one more thing that can be offline, out of date, or blocked when
  somebody is trying to get a server running at midnight.

  Positions come from the server rather than from anybody's game, because the
  server already knows them. That means voice does not depend on which SkyMP
  client build people run, and nobody can move their own voice around by
  editing a file.

  A COMMAND STAYS UNTIL THE GAMEMODE SAYS IT RAN.

  GET /commands used to empty this queue in one splice, before the gamemode
  had read a byte of the answer. Its poll() then parsed the body inside a
  catch that returned, so a batch that failed to parse, or an answer lost to
  its two second timeout, was gone from here and never run by anybody, with
  no word to whoever typed it.

  So a gamemode that asks with ?ack=1 is handed the queue without it being
  emptied, each command carrying an id, and takes away what it ran with
  POST /commands/ack. A plain GET /commands still empties the queue exactly
  as before, because a gamemode from before this change never acknowledges
  anything and would be handed the same commands on every poll.

  The id is a stamp made when this process starts, then a counter, so an id
  from before a restart can never be mistaken for one after it. The gamemode
  remembers the ids it has run and skips one that comes round again, which is
  what stops a lost acknowledgement turning into a second teleport.

 * sees every line. The game server cannot: chat goes this way round precisely
 * because adding a packet type to skymp5-client would mean recompiling it.
 *
 * ONE FILE A DAY, ONE LINE A MESSAGE, APPENDED AND NEVER REWRITTEN. A log
 * that gets rewritten is not evidence, and an append is also the only shape
 * that survives this process being killed mid-write: the worst case is one
 * truncated last line rather than a file nobody can parse. The reader skips a
 * line it cannot read for exactly that reason.
 *
 * THE PROFILE ID COMES OFF THE TOKEN, not off the message. onJoin already
 * does that work and records whether it was proven, and that flag is written
 * with every line: a line from an unproven join is still worth keeping and is
 * not worth hanging anybody on.
 *
 * SLASH COMMANDS ARE KEPT TOO. They are queued for the game server rather
 * than broadcast, so nobody else sees them, but somebody typed them and

   Measured 18 Oct on the box: the dev chat log for 17 Oct had 444 lines and
   every one was a command line, most of them the front plugin telling the
   game server what only the client can see (docs\systems\commands.md, "Lines
   the game sends itself"): /place 130, /joinpass 102, /loadorderlight and
   /loadorder 42 each, /afk 33, /pick 33, /party 24. Nobody typed or pressed
   any of them. They go on a change or a timer (the pass every minute, the
   load order every two minutes, /place whenever the weather or the roof
   changes, /afk active while somebody is at the keys, /racemenu every minute
   while the race menu is up) or as a panel opens and asks for its view
   (/pick refresh, /party refresh, /trade refresh). The game server reads
   them as reports and answers most with nothing. The chat log is for what
   somebody said, typed or pressed, so staff reading it for a report read
   that and not the client.

   WHAT DECIDES IT. The line's whole text has to be one of the shapes below,
   each exactly what thornswood-front.js builds, and the line has to come
   with press, which the chat page sets only on the plugin's own lines and a
   key's (thornswood-chat.js, say with auto). Neither alone is enough. press
   is the client's word and anybody with a console can put it on any line, so
   on its own it would let somebody keep a typed /tp out of the log; here it
   only ever leaves out a line that is a report by its shape, which the game
   server takes the same way whoever sent it. A report shape typed into the
   chat box comes with no press, so it is written: somebody typed it.
   tests\test-2723-plugin-reports.js holds this list to the plugin's own
   send sites, so a report added there without a shape here fails the build.

   A report is still queued for the game server like every other line: this
   decides the chat log and nothing else. What stays written of the plugin's
   lines: the keys' and E's (/lock, /key, /moldhere, /plot, /ride e,
   /merchant e, /repair, /treat), the K panel's picks (/pick <what>), the
   "I am still here" button (/afk here), and the wait in line (#1131):

   that one was sent and never the pass itself (#937).

   That "/line" is not something a person typed: the menu's front plugin says
   it every ten seconds while somebody waits for a seat (every two for the
   first twenty), so the gamemode keeps the place and a menu can ask again
   after this service restarts. It was written every time, about six lines a
   minute for each person waiting and seven thousand an hour for twenty, and
   staff reading the log for a report scrolled past them. The connection's
   own waiting mark (me.inLine, set by lineMark after this is asked) already
   says whether it is waiting, so the "/line" that starts the wait is written,
   and so is the first one after "/line leave", on a new connection, or after
   this service restarts. "/line leave" ends the wait and "/line hand" gives
   the place away; each is said once and written once, like every other

/* ------------------------------------------------------------- captions ---
 *
 * WHAT SOMEBODY SAYS ON VOICE, AS WORDS ABOVE THEIR HEAD (#2475). Patrick,
 * 12 Oct: "so it's not only just chat but also what players say".
 *
 * The audio never comes here (it goes between people's machines), so the
 * words are made on the speaker's own machine and only the text comes
 * here, as { t: 'caption', text }. This decides who sees it and nothing
 * else: it does not make words out of anything, and it does not keep them.
 *
 * OFF UNLESS THORNSWOOD_CAPTIONS IS on. Nothing sends a caption yet, and the
 * decisions on #2475 (where the words are made, whether they are kept,
 * whether they also go in the chat box) are still open there, so a service started
 * without the setting drops every caption, and /health says which it is.
 *
 * NOBODY'S VOICE IS SHOWN UNLESS THEY SAID SO. A person's captions go out
 * only after one of their connections has sent { t: 'captions', share: true }.
 * { see: false } stops them being sent anybody else's. Both are kept for
 * the profile, not the connection, because the launcher's voice page and the
 * game's chat each hold one, and both are forgotten when the last of them
 * closes, so every session starts from what the client says, never from
 * what this process remembers.
 *
 * WHO SEES IT is who could hear it: the same cell, and the reach of the
 * voice mode the speaker is in (headlines.captionReach: 7, 30 or 85 metres,
 * as the speaking mark). No fresh position for the speaker is nobody but
 * themselves, never everybody, unlike a typed line when the feed is down:
 * a caption is somebody's voice, and voice is never worldwide. The speaker's
 * own connections always get it, so they can see what was made of them.
 * A listener who turned the speaker's text off gets none of theirs.
 *
 * ONLY WHILE THEY ARE TALKING: the talk key down, or up for less than
 * CAPTION_TAIL_MS, which is how long the words for the last thing said can
 * take to come. Staff silence drops them, as it closes the microphone. A
 * caption at any other time did not come from a voice, so it goes nowhere.
 *
 * NOT IN THE CHAT LOG, and not in the service log. Whether voice words are
 * kept is one of the open decisions; until it is made, they are not.
 *
 * Three at once, then one a second, per connection: a sentence is one
 * caption, and the bucket only stops a machine that sends them as fast as
 * it can.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER IS A SETTING, with these as the defaults, so the server's
 * staff tune it without a release:
 *   THORNSWOOD_CAPTION_TAIL_MS    how long after the key comes up words still go (2000)
 *   THORNSWOOD_CAPTION_BURST      how many at once (3)
 *   THORNSWOOD_CAPTION_REFILL_MS  how often one more is earned (1000)
 *   THORNSWOOD_CAPTION_REACH      the furthest a caption goes, in units, never
 *                                 past the speaker's own voice reach; unset is
 *                                 the voice reach itself
 *   THORNSWOOD_CAPTION_TEXT_MUTE  off lets a personal text mute leave captions
 *                                 alone, so only the voice switch hides them
 *                                 on the client (on when unset)

 *
 * HOW FAST ONE CONNECTION CAN TALK TO THE ROOM. The To Do List, entry 149:

 * 400 character cap, so one open console could fill every screen in the
 * world faster than anybody could read it, let alone answer it.
 *
 * A TOKEN BUCKET ON THE PEER RECORD. Five lines at once, then one more every
 * second and a half, which is forty a minute: more than anybody types, and
 * the five cover a quick back and forth. It lives on the peer that onJoin
 * writes rather than in the broadcast, because the broadcast is the part
 * that changes when chat goes local, and a limit written into it would go
 * with it.
 *
 * SAID LINES ONLY. The handler asks after the slash branch, never before.
 * The plugins report gameplay down this same socket as slash lines: /chopped
 * on every fall of the axe, /place as somebody walks about, /ate, /burn, the
 * journal, the party and the trade window. A limit ahead of that branch
 * would lose somebody's firewood for talking too much.
 *
 * DROPPED, AND THE SENDER IS TOLD ONCE. A held line is not queued, because a
 * flood that is queued is still a flood, only later. The notice goes to the
 * sender alone, the first time a line of theirs is dropped, and not again
 * until one of their lines has gone through, so the notice cannot become a
 * flood of its own. A dropped line is not in the chat log as said, because
 * it never reached the room; the service log says who was slowed.
 *
 * PER CONNECTION, NOT PER ACCOUNT. This was on purpose while
 * THORNSWOOD_VOICE_AUTH could be log, when the profile id on a join was
 * whatever the message claimed and a bucket keyed on it would have let
 * anybody empty somebody else's; since #1303 every join is proven.
 * A reconnect starts with a full bucket; it costs a join and a roster to
 * everybody, so it slows a flood rather than stopping a determined one.

  Patrick, 23 September, with it on his screen: "Chat lost the server. Trying

  never noticed anything.

  This service answered pings and never sent one. A websocket that says
  nothing for long enough is closed by whatever is between the two ends, and
  between these two ends is Caddy: the chat page reaches the service through
  wss://thornswood.net/voice/, which is a reverse proxy, and a proxy that
  sees no traffic eventually drops the connection. Voice traffic kept a
  speaking socket busy and the position feed kept a PEER busy, so the ones
  that died were the quiet ones: somebody standing about with the chat window
  open and nobody near them.

  A ping every twenty five seconds is under every default idle timeout worth
  naming, costs two bytes, and is the thing the protocol has for exactly
  this. It also gives a dead socket somewhere to fail, which is better than
  discovering it on the next thing somebody types.

  The ping kept whatever sits in between from closing a quiet socket, and did

  something at least once a ping. A laptop that sleeps, or a Wi-Fi link that

  kept a connection open to nobody. Measured on 21 September, the launcher's

  dead at this end.

  Three pings unanswered is gone. The Caddyfile in scripts\deploy sets no

  ONE SLOW CONNECTION MUST NOT GROW THIS PROCESS WITHOUT LIMIT.

  Every message went out through send(), which ignored what socket.write
  returns. When somebody's link cannot keep up, or their machine stops
  reading, node does not refuse a write: it keeps the bytes in memory and
  answers false. Nothing listened, so the position feed piled up behind that
  one socket five times a second. Measured on 24 September with a copy of
  this service on loopback and one websocket that joined and never read, at
  1,500 rows: once the loopback buffers were full the queue grew about
  0.75 MB a second, 15 MB after twenty seconds, and nothing ever gave it back.

  The To Do List entry: "For state that is superseded every tick, dropping is
  the correct answer and is what unreliable transport means." So a socket that
  has said false is marked backed until it drains, and the position tick skips
  it (sendLossy): the next tick carries newer positions anyway. Everything else
  stays on send, because welcome, chat, signalling and voice modes each say
  something that is not said again.

  The roster sits between the two (sendLatest). Every join and every leave
  sends the whole room to everybody, so when a room fills at once, as it does
  when the service restarts and every page reconnects, each socket was sent a
  roster per arrival: about 1.3 MB for the first in at two hundred people.
  Since #2332 the joins and leaves of one turn of the event loop share one
  roster (sendRoster), which is most of a storm; this still keeps what a
  slow reader is owed to one.
  Queued in full, that tripped the ceiling below for anybody slow to read,
  and those closed sockets would reconnect into another burst. On
  24 September test-cull.js, whose two hundred sockets join together, had 42
  of them closed that way in one run on a busy machine.

  Only the newest roster means anything, so a backed socket keeps just that
  one and is sent it when it drains, or ahead of the next message it is sent,
  so nothing arrives out of order.

  What is left to grow is that reliable traffic, for a socket that never
  reads. Past QUEUE_CEILING it is closed and left to reconnect, which both
  pages already do: the launcher's voice host after two seconds, the chat
  overlay on its own retry. The gamemode's rows come
  out about the size they went in, so the 200,000 byte /positions limit keeps
  one position message under about 200 KB, a fifth of the ceiling, and a
  single tick does not trip it. Since each person is sent only the people
  they could hear (viewsOf), most ticks are far smaller than that. Reaching
  the ceiling takes a couple of thousand chat lines, or hundreds of call
  offers, that nobody has read.

/*
  WHAT ONE TURN SENDS A SOCKET GOES TO THE KERNEL IN BATCHES (#2390).

  Every message used to be its own socket.write, and each one went to the
  kernel on its own. When a room fills, every pair of voice pages trades an
  offer, an answer and their candidates through here, about fourteen
  messages a pair: N squared writes. Profiled on 19 Oct with
  voice/load-voice.js at 200 people (19,900 pairs, 278,600 relayed
  messages): handling what pages sent took 4.1 s of the one thread, and
  3.0 s of that was inside socket.write, the kernel write per message.
  Everything else (reading the frames, signal(), JSON and framing) came to
  about 1.1 s, and the copies in that are cut too (frame, and feed).

  So a socket is corked by its first write in a turn of the event loop and
  uncorked after every I/O callback of that turn has run (setImmediate, as
  the roster does, with no timer in between), or sooner, the moment a write
  returns false: what is corked has reached the socket's high water mark
  (16 KB), and it goes to the kernel then as one writev rather than waiting
  for the end of the turn. So the kernel is handed a turn's messages in
  batches of about 16 KB, in the order they were written, and nothing is
  held past the turn. A write returned false at 16 KB before this as well,
  whether or not the kernel took it, so backed means what it meant, and the

  A page builds its peer connections when a roster arrives, and at no other

  one, relay included when one is set: whoever is sent a roster has a socket
  its join token proved at the handshake, which is who #1307 says may have
  the relay. So the relay is handed over the proven socket, minted at the
  moment each connection is built, and a page that has been in the room for
  an hour gets a credential as fresh as one that joined a second ago.

  It used to come from POST /ice with the page's join token in the body. A
  token is good for two minutes and opens one connection (#1322), so a page
  held a valid one only around the moment it connected: the game's overlay
  sent the one its connection was opened with, which had run out for most of
  a session, and from then on was handed STUN only. /ice now reads no token.

/*
  ONE ROSTER FOR EVERYTHING THAT CHANGED THE ROOM IN ONE TURN (#2332).

  announce() used to send the roster to every socket the moment anybody
  joined or left, and stringified it once per socket. When the service
  restarts every page comes back at once, so letting N people in cost N
  rosters to each of N sockets, each the size of the room: N squared
  messages, and N cubed bytes and stringify work. Measured on One on 11 Oct
  with voice/load-voice.js, two sockets a person: 100 people held the one
  node thread for up to 2.4 s at a time, 200 took 20 s to get in, and 400
  never did.

  A roster says only who is in the room now; a page reconciles its
  connections against the whole list each time (onPeers in
  launcher/voice-host.html, reconcile in game/ui/thornswood-voice.js), so a
  roster that is replaced before it is sent loses nothing. So announce()
  only marks the roster as due, and it is sent once, after every join and
  leave this turn of the event loop has handled (setImmediate runs after the
  I/O callbacks of the turn that queued it, with no timer in between). A
  storm of joins that arrives together is one roster to each socket, not one
  per arrival, and the message is stringified and framed once for the whole
  room. Nothing on the wire changes shape: the same { t: 'peers', peers,
  iceServers } a page always had, after its welcome, as before.

  The order #1869 depends on still holds. Every socket is written the same
  roster in one loop, so a newcomer's roster and the roster naming them to
  everybody else go out together, before the newcomer can have read theirs
  and sent anyone an offer. A socket that is backed keeps only the newest,
  as before (sendLatest), and send() writes it ahead of anything later.

  WHO IS TOLD ABOUT WHOM.

  Every peer used to be sent the whole snapshot five times a second: every
  person's coordinates, facing, cell and name, wherever they were. That is two
  faults in one, and it is entry 282 on the To Do List. Anybody holding a
  socket learned where everybody in the world was standing. And the traffic
  grew with the square of the room, against a box that measured 93 Mbit/s and
  an 8 TB monthly cap. voice/test-cull.js measures it on the wire with
  two hundred people across ten cells: 5,284,000 bytes a tick, 26 MB a
  second, 380 GB over a four hour evening, sent whole; 492,203 bytes a tick,
  2.5 MB a second, culled. Nine of those ten cells are interiors where all
  twenty can hear each other, so that is close to the floor voice needs.

  So each person is told about three kinds of people and nobody else:

    themselves, because every client places everybody against its own row
      and does nothing at all without it;
    anybody in the same cell within HEAR_UNITS, which is everybody any
      speaking mode on any client could reach;
    their own party, wherever they are, because the party strip draws an
      arrow and a distance to every member anywhere in the world off this
      same feed (ts-ui/thornswood-party.js), and gold on it means "somewhere
      else". The gamemode sends the party id with each row for this.

  A missing row is already silence on every client. The overlay
  (ts-ui/thornswood-voice.js) and the launcher's voice host both replace
  their table with each message and set the gain to
  nothing for a person with no row, exactly as for another cell. So no client
  changes, and nobody needs a "you left their range" message: the next view
  simply does not have them in it. Connections are still opened and closed by
  the roster, as they always were.

  NEVER TIGHTER THAN A CLIENT, because that cuts people off mid sentence.
  Another cell is silence on every client, and the longest reach any client
  has is the overlay's yell at 85 metres (thornswood-voice.js MODES).
  HEAR_UNITS is 100 metres, so a yell fading out at its edge is never cut
  before the client's own falloff reaches nothing. Raise this before raising
  a range there: voice/test-cull.js reads the client range tables and
  fails when one outgrows it.

  AND ONLY WHAT CHANGED. Issue #482.

  After the cull each person was still sent their whole view five times a
  second, whether anybody in it had moved or not: a room of twenty standing
  round a fire was twenty rows to each of them, every 200 ms, all evening.
  Most of an evening is people standing, so most of that said nothing new.

  So each peer keeps what it was last sent, row by row, as the text of the
  row. The first tick after a join is the whole view, { t: 'pos' }, which is
  what every tick used to be. After that a tick sends { t: 'moved' }, with
  only the rows that differ from what that peer holds and the ids that have
  left its view in gone (out of range, another cell, gone stale, logged
  off), and nothing at all when neither. Every client applies moved on top of
  the table the last pos gave it: launcher/voice-host.html and
  game/ui/thornswood-voice.js.

  A tick skipped for a backed socket (sendLossy) leaves that peer holding
  something older than this side thinks, so its record is dropped and the
  next tick it is sent is the whole view again. voice/test-moved.js measures
  the bill before and after on the wire.

  A quiet socket is no longer sent something five times a second, which is
  why the pages keep their own ping (SILENT_AFTER, above).

  HOW OFTEN ONE PLACE MAY ASK FOR A TOKEN OR OPEN A SOCKET (#1323).

  Neither door counted anything. Measured on 5 October: sixty POST /token and
  sixty socket handshakes from one address, one after another, were every one
  answered. Each /token is an HMAC and a request to the site, and each socket
  is a peer, a roster sent to everybody, and a place in every position tick.

  So each door takes so many a minute from one place, and past that answers
  429 with Retry-After, never a quiet drop. The rules are the site's own
  limiters' (site/server.js, the report and login limits). A place is the
  socket's address or, behind Caddy, the last X-Forwarded-For hop, which is
  the one Caddy wrote, believed only when the socket is loopback. An IPv6
  address counts as its /64, because one home is handed a whole /64. The
  table holds only a hash of it, under a key made at each start. Only what
  was let in counts, so a script hammering on a refusal does not keep the
  people behind the same address locked out. This machine itself, loopback
  with nobody's address forwarded, is not counted: the box's own scripts and
  the harnesses.

  The launcher asks for a token whenever its voice page or the game's chat
  is about to connect, since a token opens one connection (#1322): one each
  when Play is pressed, then one per try after a loss, the tries spaced as
  below, so twenty a minute is a few people behind one address reconnecting
  at once. A page that lost its
  socket tries again after one to thirty seconds (thornswood-chat.js) or two
  to sixty (voice-host.html), so sixty sockets a minute is several people
  reconnecting at once. Both are settings, so they can be tuned on the box
  without a release.

  HOW MANY PEOPLE THE SERVICE TAKES AT ONCE (#481).

  The game server seats so many (records\most-online.json, people and the
  staff seats over it) and nothing here counted at all, so the one service
  every person in the world holds a socket to, and every person waiting in
  line at the menu as well, took everybody who came. The issue's words: cap
  one without the other and it only moves where it breaks.

  THORNSWOOD_VOICE_MOST is the most PEOPLE, not sockets: a person holds one
  socket for the launcher's voice page and one for the game's chat, and a
  reconnect can overlap the socket it replaces until that one is let go, so
  each of those counts once, by the profile its join token proved. A profile
  that already holds a socket is always let in, so nobody in the room loses
  their second page or a reconnect to a full room. Install-Voice.ps1 sets it
  from records\most-online.json (voice). Unset or 0 is no cap, which is how
  this ran until now.

  Past it, a new profile's socket is opened, told in one chat line why, and
  closed with 1013, "try again later", rather than refused at the handshake:
  a browser never shows a page why a handshake failed, and the game's chat
  draws a line from the service, so the person reads the reason where they
  would have talked. Both pages then try again on their own backoff (two
  seconds to a minute, and one to thirty), each try with a token of its own.
  The token it came with is spent, as every token is on its handshake. The
  log says it once a minute at most, and /health counts the refusals.

  Who is allowed to connect at all, and who they are once they have.

  The room used to take a stranger's word for everything. join carried a
  profileId, nothing checked it, and that one number is the whole of somebody's
  identity here: send theirs and you are them. You heard every conversation in
  the world, your voice arrived as them, and because the roster carries
  positions you learned where every person lives. The port was open on every
  interface, so none of this needed the game, an account, or the mod list.

  So identity comes from a token now, and never from the message. The launcher
  proves who it is to /token with the Discord ticket it already holds, the site
  answers whether that ticket owns that profile, and what comes back is signed
  by this service. The token goes with the WebSocket handshake, in
  Sec-WebSocket-Protocol, and opens that one connection and no other: see
  WHO THIS IS, BEFORE THE SOCKET OPENS over the upgrade handler. The
  profileId in the join message is ignored.

  The key is this service's own, made on first run and kept beside it. Not the
  server password: everybody who plays here holds that, which is right for
  reading the character register and useless for telling two of them apart.

  A connection that cannot prove itself is refused, always (#1303).
  THORNSWOOD_VOICE_AUTH used to choose: on refused it, log let it in and
  wrote a line, off was the old behaviour. log was meant for the one release
  the tokens took to go out and stayed the default for every service started
  without the setting. Live and dev were already on; nothing reads the
  setting now, and /health says auth on so the scripts that read it still
  can.

/*
  HOW LONG A TOKEN IS GOOD FOR, AND FOR HOW MANY CONNECTIONS (#1322).

  It was good for an hour and for any number of connections. The launcher
  minted one at Play, wrote it to voice-token.txt, handed the same string to
  its own voice page and to the game, renewed it every half hour, and every
  reconnect presented it again. So it was a bearer pass: whoever read it, off
  that file, out of a pack it should never have been in (19 September), or
  off the wire, joined as that person beside them for up to an hour, and
  nothing could tell the copy from the real one.

  Now a token opens one connection. The handshake that presents it spends it,
  and a second handshake with it is refused and written down, because a token
  used twice was copied. Nobody carries one any more: the launcher's page and
  the game each ask the launcher for a fresh token at the moment they connect,
  so two minutes is plenty, and the hour it once needed (Skyrim loading
  between Play and the first join) is no longer anywhere in the path.

  And it is good only to the copy of this service that made it. The list of
  spent tokens lives in this process, so a token minted before it started is
  refused rather than trusted to be unspent.

  Where everybody's browser should look to find each other.

  Three pages build an RTCPeerConnection and all three had the same Google STUN
  server typed into them. STUN alone only works when both ends can be reached
  once they know where to look. Behind a symmetric NAT, some mobile networks and
  a lot of corporate ones, they cannot, and those two people simply never hear
  each other while everybody else sounds fine. That is the worst shape a fault
  can take: it is not down, it is down for one pair.

  TURN is the answer to that, and TURN needs a server to relay through, which is
  not something that can be typed into a web page. So the list lives here and
  the pages are handed it, on the roster (announce). Adding TURN later is then
  a setting on the VPS and a restart, rather than editing three files and
  shipping a release.

  With a secret set, each browser is handed its own credential that expires,
  built the way coturn's REST scheme expects: the username is an expiry
  timestamp and the password is an HMAC of it. Nobody gets a standing password
  to a relay, which matters because that relay would carry their bandwidth bill.

  VPS, named by location only. Install-Voice.ps1 writes this service's whole
  environment into the command line of the shell that starts it, which the
  same script reads back out of the process list, so THORNSWOOD_TURN_SECRET
  would put the relay's key wherever that line is shown. The join token key
  already lives in a file here, token-key.txt above, and this is the same
  idea: the relay's static-auth-secret goes in turn-key.txt in the service's
  folder on the VPS, put there by hand, and is read once at start. The
  variable still wins when it is set.

  No file, which is every box today, changes nothing: nothing is logged, /ice
  answers the same bytes, and /health the same fields, with only the build name

  THE CHARACTER REGISTER IS GONE, 23 September.

  It was three routes, /whoami, /claim and /owners, a file called owners.json
  and a shared secret in secret.txt. All three refused every real caller with
  403, because each required doc.password to equal that secret and the launcher
  deliberately sent none: Account.cs and CharSync.cs were written that way and
  were themselves deleted on 20 September. So owners.json was never written by
  any launcher and never read by one, and CharSync.Sync returned null on every
  launch, including the seven second wait it cost at Play.

  The identity that actually flows is the site's linked.json, keyed by Discord
  id. Two registers were never wanted and one of them never worked.

  Taken out rather than left refusing, because a route that answers 403 to
  every real caller is a thing somebody will one day try to fix instead of
  delete. tools\Characters.ps1, which existed only to read /owners, went with
  it; its own header already said the register had not been fed since
  20 September.

  Origin https://evil.example was answered 101 and its join welcomed. This
  service sets no cookie and a join proves itself with its own token, so such
  a socket borrows nothing of the visitor's; what it gets is each visitor's
  browser, from that visitor's address, as a client for free.

  So a browser's socket must come from the game's pages or the launcher's
  voice page, which are loaded off disk and say null (file:// in older
  Chromium), and are let in. No Origin at all is not a browser (a harness, a
  script), which this was never meant to stop. Anything else is refused
  before the handshake. An Origin naming the host the request was made to
  was let in too, for the page this service served of its own, until that
  page went (#1822); a page on this host is now refused like any other
  website's.

  What this cannot close: a sandboxed frame on any website also says null,
  and nothing in the request tells it apart from the game's own page.

  WHO THIS IS, BEFORE THE SOCKET OPENS (#1337, #1322).

  The handshake used to be answered for anybody, and who they were was the
  first message after it. So anybody could hold a socket open and send it
  whatever they liked without a credential at all, and the token, once it
  came, was the same hour long string on every connection.

  A browser cannot set a header on a WebSocket, but it can offer protocols,
  and those travel as Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: the pages offer 'thornswood'
  and their token. Before anything is answered the token is read and spent.
  A handshake without one, with one that does not check out, or with one
  that has already opened a connection is answered 403 and closed, and never
  becomes a socket. The 101 names 'thornswood', which is what a browser needs
  to hear back to keep the connection; the token is never echoed.

  (entry 6). Behind Caddy it does not need to be: Caddy holds 443 for the
  site, carries /voice/ and /voice-dev/ through to here, and this listens on
  loopback only, one door with a certificate on it, wss:// rather than ws://.

  Live and dev have run on loopback since 29 September, set on the command
  line, and every launcher has used the https address the feed gives it.
  Loopback is the default since #1304, so a service started without the
  setting does not open the port again. THORNSWOOD_VOICE_BIND=0.0.0.0 still
  answers every interface, for a machine with no proxy in front, and even
  then nothing that carries a token or a ticket is taken over it
  (plainFromOutside).
