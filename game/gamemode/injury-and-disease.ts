  WOUNDS AND DISEASE, ON THE CHARACTER THE WAY HUNGER IS (#1383).

  docs/systems/injury.md and docs/systems/disease.md are the design, and every
  number below is one of theirs, named where it is used. A wound and a disease
  are a short list on the character, in the thornswoodHurt property, ticked by
  this server. Not a mod script and not the old survival mod: nothing here
  runs on the client except the lines that draw what you have.

  WHAT THE SERVER CAN SEE, AND SO WHAT STARTS EACH ONE TODAY.

    A burn     the client says when it catches fire and when the fire goes out
               (/burn, the same report the spreading uses), and the coals deal
               BURN_PER_SECOND a second on that client while it burns. So the
               server times the fire and knows what it dealt.
    A chill    an hour of sleep on open ground, read off the rest the needs
               block already holds (resting at the sitting rate, with no roof
               over you), or an hour at spent cold, read off its temperature.
    Wound fever and bite sickness
               a cut, a bite or a bad burn left untreated for 10 minutes.
    Food sickness and fouled water
               what somebody ate or drank, which is the meal and drink work
               (#1382). It calls exposed() with what it was, and the chances
               are here, beside the disease they start.
    A cut, a break, a bite
               the blow that lands, by Patrick's answer on #1383 (blow, below):
               a power or sneak attack with a blade or an axe, or an arrow or a
               bolt, cuts; a power attack with a mace or a warhammer breaks an
               arm or a leg; an animal that bites, bites. Staff can still give
               one with /hurt for a scene.

  WHAT TREATS THEM (treat, below): torn cloth, a bandage, a splint, a poultice
  and a physicker's remedy, the last four items in Thornswood-Content.esp, and
  a physicker setting a bone. Yours from the inventory, somebody else's from
  the look prompt, both through one panel (game/ui/thornswood-treat.js).

  GOING DOWN IS NOT HERE YET. The engine now asks mp.onDying before health
  reaching zero kills, before anything is sent (#1626), so that is the moment
  this file can say "down, not dead": refuse the death and keep them at a
  health of its own. The rest of going down (the downed flag the clients are
  sent, no fighting or casting while down, being stabilized, the wake) is
  #2681. Until it is built a bleed that empties your health is a death with
  no killer, the world's, and the temple keeps your wounds.

    "Ill. The weary penalties of the closest meter: cold for a chill, hunger

    ill, and at least bad while you are badly ill, so a disease never stacks a
    second copy of a penalty you already have.

    lasts is minutes, and from says what it is counted from: a chill clears in
    2 hours from catching it; food sickness and fouled water last 30 and 45
    minutes once they show. 0 lasts until cured. bad is whether 20 untreated
    minutes after showing make it bad.

    Bite sickness is not on the page's list of closest meters. It is a wound
    disease that turns bad the way a fever does, so it reads as a fever does:
    hunger and rest (Patrick's answer on #1383, 4 October).

  /*
    WHICH BLOW OPENS A WOUND. Patrick's answer on #1383, 4 October:

      a cut    an unblocked power or sneak attack with a blade or an axe, or
               an arrow or a bolt that lands;
      a break  an unblocked power attack with a mace or a warhammer, the arm
               or the leg at even odds;
      a bite   an unblocked hit from an animal that bites: a wolf, a dog, a
               bear, a sabre cat, a skeever, a spider, a chaurus, a troll, a
               horker or a slaughterfish.

    A bash is a shove with the shield or the hilt, and a spell is none of
    these. Held back until a bandage existed, because a cut only a mage could
    stop would kill anybody else in about a minute.

    WHAT THE WEAPON IS, off its record. The weapon type keyword Skyrim puts on
    every weapon (WeapTypeSword and the rest), read by its editor id so no form
    id is remembered here; failing that, the animation type, the first byte of
    DNAM. A bow and a crossbow are told by the animation type alone, the way
    the perks block tells them. The animation type cannot tell a battleaxe
    from a warhammer, which swing alike, so without a keyword that one opens
    nothing.

    WHICH ANIMALS BITE is the warrior block's own lines of races by animal
    (WARRIOR_KILL), so a wolf here is the same races a wolf is there, and the
    race is the one the engine says the body has (raceEdidOf).

    MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. OnHit is raised before the engine works the damage
    out, and a hit the engine then throws away raised it all the same. So
    health is read at the event and again on the next turn, the way the perks
    and the maneuvers measure a blow, and only a blow that took health and
    left the person standing opens a wound. A blow that killed is the death.

    WHAT TREATS A WOUND, AND WHO MAKES IT. injury.md, who treats what, and

      torn cloth   anybody, and no item: a bleed from 2 a second to 1. It does
                   not change the fever chance.
      a bandage    a Haberdasher's, at the loom, used by anybody: stops a bleed,
                   and wound fever is 10% instead of 40%.
      a splint     a Woodwright's, at the kiln: holds a break. An expert healing
                   spell sets only a break that is splinted.
      a poultice   a Physicker's, novice, at the alchemy lab: wound fever 5%.
      a remedy     a Physicker's, advanced, at the alchemy lab: closes a cut the
                   way a bandage does, and clears one ordinary disease, wound
                   fever first (disease.md: "the better answer to wound fever").
      setting      a physicker, no item: sets a break, and its 3 days start. A
                   master physicker also clears a crooked heal.

    The four items are MISC records in Thornswood-Content.esp
    (scripts/mods/Add-ContentRecords.py). Skyrim's inventory cannot use a MISC,
    so they are used the way a repair kit is (#1384): in the inventory a key
    opens a panel of your wounds and what you can do for them, and on somebody
    hurt the look prompt's key opens the same panel for them. Its buttons send
    /treat, and nobody types it.

    NOTHING IS TAKEN UNLESS IT HELPS. Each treatment first finds the wound it
    would help, and a refusal leaves the item in the pack.
