// ==== thornswood needs: hunger, thirst and exhaustion ====
/*
  ============================================================================
  HUNGER, THIRST AND EXHAUSTION, AND THE NUMBERS ARE INVENTED ON PURPOSE.

  Blade Da Razor, 22 September, in the Proffesions/Classes forum, "a mix of
  mine and patrick's pitch for the system":

    Hunger   standard, different foods replenish different amounts, the meter
             deteriorates over time, and low hunger gives negative effects to
             movement, attacks, mana and blocking.
    Thirst   standard but depletes twice as fast. Ale fills it faster and has
             negative effects. Low thirst hits mana and movement.
    Exhaust  "standard, takes hours to completely deplete... it would be over 3
             times larger than the hunger meter. (3 meals get it? Lol)". Rest
             by sitting, at a campfire, or at an inn, which is faster; lying in
             a bed at an inn or your home WHEN YOU LOG OUT gives a bonus when
             you come back. Low exhaustion has negative effects to everything
             including your ability to craft. Working your skilled profession
             drains it faster, and a higher rank drains it slower.

  Grim Reefer added the bard, and Patrick said yes to it: somebody playing
  music in an inn makes everyone there recover faster. "It would encourage
  people to hang out at taverns." Patrick: "I like that Idea too!"

  Patrick, 22 September: "I want for the exhaustion to be able to actually
  sleep in beds and stuff", and then, asked for the balance: "you csn invent
  the balance and we an go form there".

  SO EVERY NUMBER BELOW IS MINE AND NONE OF IT IS MEASURED. That is the point
  of this block existing before it is right: there is nothing to argue with
  until there is something to play. They are gathered in NEEDS so one table is
  the whole of the balance, and moving a number here is the whole of a change.

  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No death, no collapse, no forced sleep.
  Nothing in this block can kill anybody or take a turn away from them, and an
  empty meter is a person who is worse at things rather than a person who
  stops playing. A roleplay server people leave running while they talk is the
  wrong place for a meter that punishes being idle, and this is the first
  version of something nobody has felt yet.

    Meters run 0 to 100 and 100 is full. Everything is per REAL hour, because
    a person's session is real time and Skyrim's clock runs twenty times
    faster: a meter on game time would empty while somebody read a sign.

    THE THREE RATES ARE BLADE'S SHAPE. Food empties in six hours, drink in
    three because it goes twice as fast, and rest in twenty, which is over
    three times the food meter as he asked. Six hours is longer than most
    sessions on purpose: the first version should be felt at the end of a long
    evening, not at the end of an hour.

      Patrick, 23 September, after playing with them: "I think the food,
      water, and rest go down wayyyyy to slowly like it needs to go down 2.5x
      this speed".

      The old shape was food in six hours, drink in three, rest in twenty,
      chosen so the first version would be felt at the end of a long evening
      rather than the end of an hour. An evening is not how anybody plays
      this: a session is two hours and nothing ever moved far enough to
      matter. So food empties in two hours and twenty four minutes, drink in
      an hour and twelve, and rest in eight hours, which is a meter that is
      still about sleeping rather than about eating.

      The proportions are Blade's and are untouched: drink goes twice as fast
      as food, and rest is over three times food.

      TEMPERATURE, AND IT IS THE ONE METER THAT IS NOT A CLOCK.

      Patrick, 22 September: "I forgot to say temp for cold/heat stuff for
      like snow and rain and swimming and fire and stuff."

      The other three only ever fall. This one moves BOTH WAYS toward whatever
      the place you are standing in is worth, so a meter at 50 is comfortable,
      0 is freezing and 100 is overheating. Standing by a fire in a blizzard
      should settle somewhere reasonable rather than one of them winning, and
      a target plus a rate is the shape that does that on its own.

      settleMinutes is a HALF LIFE, not a rate, and it used to be a rate. It
      said 60 "per real hour" and was fed into a power of a half, which is not
      what a rate means: the arithmetic came out at about half a point a
      minute, so walking into the Bannered Mare and standing in the fire would
      have taken the better part of an hour to read as warm. Patrick's five
      screenshots all say Fine 50 and the reason is mostly that nothing was
      reporting a place, but this would have been the next thing wrong.

      A half life says what it does: three minutes to get halfway to wherever
      you are standing, nine to be most of the way there. Long enough that
      crossing a bridge in the rain is not a meter event, short enough that
      going indoors out of a blizzard is felt while you are still taking your
      boots off.

      THE PLACES ARE WORTH WHAT PATRICK NAMED. Snow and swimming pull down,
      fire pulls up, rain is milder than snow, and indoors is simply
      comfortable. Everything unnamed is comfortable too, because a world
      where every unclassified cell is dangerous is a world that punishes
      walking into a room nobody has thought about yet.

      HOW FAST THE METER GOES WHERE IT IS GOING, AND IT IS TWO NUMBERS.

      Patrick, 23 September, standing in the Bannered Mare's fire pit with
      the client finally reporting it: "Fire is still not changing temp but I
      do catch on fire now and take damage". The client was right, the server
      was right, and the meter was moving: at one half life of three minutes,
      standing in a fire whose target is 84 took a 51 to 52.2 in ten seconds
      and 54.6 in thirty. Nobody stands in a fire for three minutes to find
      out whether a number is broken, and while they are walking about it
      never gets anywhere near the target at all.

      So warming is fast and cooling is not, which is also how it works: a
      fire warms you in seconds and a cold night takes you slowly. Thirty
      seconds to close half the gap toward warm puts a fire at 66 in ten
      seconds from 51, which is legible while you stand there; ninety seconds
      the other way means stepping back from it cools you visibly without the
      snow becoming an emergency the moment you walk into it.

      These are the only two numbers that decide whether any of this can be
      felt, so they are here and named rather than folded into one.

      WHAT KIND OF WATER, on top of being in it.

      Patrick, 23 September: "there should be different temperatures for
      different water types like ice, galciers, fresh water, shallow, etc".

      tools\waters.json reads the WATR record every cell and worldspace points
      at and sorts them into classes. This is what each class is worth, as
      degrees on or off the water place itself, so a class only ever matters
      to somebody who is actually in the water.

      THERE IS NO ICE WATER IN TAMRIEL and that is worth saying rather than
      faking: Bethesda named five records for cold water and all of them are
      Dawnguard's Frostreach. The sea off Dawnstar is the same DefaultWater as
      the sea off Riften. So the rest of a freezing swim comes from the
      weather, the hour and the height, which the exposure half already
      measures and which already apply to anybody in the water.

      SHALLOW IS THE PLACE, not the class: wading is its own word from the
      client, because how deep you are in it is the thing you can do something
      about.

    /*
      A FIRE IS A DISTANCE, NOT A PLACE.

      Patrick, 23 September: "temperature should be relative too so like if I
      am further away or closer to a fire it slowly rises and lowers as I walk
      away from the fire".

      The first version made fire one of the words the client could report and
      it beat everything else, so a campfire in a blizzard was worth exactly
      the same as the hearth in the Bannered Mare and stepping one pace back
      from either of them turned it off like a switch.

      So the client reports HOW FAR, and this is what it is worth at nothing
      and what it is worth at reach:

        at     added to the target when you are standing in it
        reach  where it has faded to nothing, in game units, and it has to be
               the same number the client scans with or half of the curve is
               off the end of it

      Added ON TOP of wherever you already are, which is what makes it read
      the way he described: indoors at a hearth is 58 and 34 more, a campfire
      in the open is 40 and 34, the same campfire in a blizzard is 16 and 34,
      and every one of them slides down to the place's own number as you walk
      away.

      AND IT SPREADS.

      Patrick, 23 September: "when people catch fire it should be able to
      spread to other people if they ade close enough".

      The client tells the server it is burning, the server looks for anybody
      standing close enough in the same cell, and their client catches. That
      is the only way round it works: the server cannot see a fire and the
      client cannot see where everybody else is standing, so each one does the
      half it can.

        spread   how close, in game units. About two paces, which is close
                 enough to be a choice rather than an ambush.
        catches  how long somebody burns for after catching it, before it goes
                 out on its own. Refreshed while they are still next to
                 whoever set them alight, so standing there is worse.
        every    how often the server looks. Two seconds, because a fire that
                 takes twenty to notice is not a fire.

      IT CANNOT RUN AWAY WITH ITSELF. Somebody who catches it becomes a source
      in their own right, which is what "spread" means, but the burn is on a
      clock and the radius is small, so a crowd standing shoulder to shoulder
      in a bonfire is the worst it gets and that is a decision they made.

      WHAT YOU ARE WEARING, AND IT IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE ANSWER.

      Patrick, 23 September: "also clothing should affect temperature depening
      on what clothes and if you are weaing them no clothes should equal colder
      some clothes/armor should be hotter than others etc".

      tools\warmth.json says what every wearable in the load order is made of
      and what it covers, read off the ARMO records. This says what that is
      WORTH, which is balance and belongs here with the rest of it.

      EVERY PIECE COUNTS ON ITS OWN. Patrick, 23 September: "different types of
      clothes and wether one is on and others are like a hat, helmet, scarf,
      cape, shirt, pants, boots, gloves, etc are all counted individually and
      not grouped". So perPart has a line for every biped slot that comes
      between weather and skin, including the ones only the mods use: the
      cloak slot, the scarf slot and both hood slots. The names are the ones
      Build-WarmthTable.js writes into the table and the two have to agree.

      perPart is how much of a person each piece of kit is. A fully dressed
      person adds up to about one, so the fractions are what each piece is
      worth against being naked: a shirt is a quarter of the answer, boots are
      a fourteenth, and going barefoot in the snow costs exactly that much.

      material is how well it keeps weather out. Fur is the best thing in the
      game and metal is the worst, which is both true and the reason anybody in
      the Pale is dressed like that. An armour with no material keyword lands
      on cloth, the middle, so an unclassified mod piece is neither a blessing
      nor a punishment.

      AND IT CUTS BOTH WAYS, which is the part that makes it a choice rather
      than a number to maximise. Warm clothes pull a cold place back toward
      comfortable. In a HOT place they push it further the other way: full
      plate at a forge is worse than a shirt, and `heat` is how much worse.

      WORKING COSTS REST, AND IT IS A COST PER SWING RATHER THAN A RATE.

      Blade: "When doing your skilled profession, it drains your Exhaustion
      faster. As you level up your skill it doesn't drain your exhaustion
      meter as fast."

      That was a multiplier on the drain for two minutes after each piece of
      work, and Patrick found what it is worth: "I didn't get anymore tired

      that is four tenths of one point for a whole spell of mining. It was
      working perfectly and nobody was ever going to feel it.

      So the work itself costs, on the swing, and the rank is what it costs
      rather than how fast the clock runs. A novice loses a point and a half
      a swing, which is twenty swings for a third of the meter and is a
      morning's work; a master loses half of that, which is the whole of what

      a campfire, a bed or bedroll nobody lends you is a little better than
      sitting, a campfire with a bedroll is better than a campfire alone, and
      so on up to your own bed. So: a seat 20, a bed or bedroll nobody can lend

      WHAT THE TIME AWAY DOES, BY WHERE SOMEBODY LOGGED OUT (#1606, #2246).

      One row for each kind of rest they were in when they left, and up for
      somebody who left on their feet. Each row is four things:

        drain  the share of the ordinary clock the whole time away costs
               hunger, thirst and rest. 1 is all of it, the same as being
               awake in the world; 0 would be nothing at all.
        floor  the time away takes no meter below this. A meter already
               under it is left where it was. 0 is no floor.
        rest   after a night away, rest is at least this. 0 gives nothing.
        food, drink  after a night away, added to hunger and to thirst, on
               what the time away left.

      Logging out in a bed was Blade's: "laying down in a bed in an inn or
      your home when you log out will give you bonuses when you come back".
      Full rest on return and 25 back on hunger and thirst, because somebody
      who slept properly did not also starve. It is a rule about where to
      sleep, not a bonus for logging out at a clever hour. Which beds give it
      was asked on #1606 and built as the suggested answer: your own bed, and
      a bed you are allowed in (a night the holder gave you, or the
      building's key or deed carried). A bed or bedroll nobody can lend you is
      the road, and gives nothing.

      #2246 asked for the rest of this table: logging out should give the
      most back, an inn or a temple the highest share, the wild the least.
      Measured on #2246 before this: every row drained the whole clock, so a
      new character who logged out anywhere but a bed of their own and came
      back after a night found hunger, thirst and rest all at 0, spent on
      all three, and every new character arrives in an inn nobody holds.

      Patrick, 12 Oct 2026, on #2246, the recommended table:
        - in a bed indoors, your own, one you are allowed in, or an inn or
          temple bed nobody holds, nothing drains while you are away;
        - anywhere else, a bedroll or a bed on the road, a seat, or on your
          feet, half the clock, and never under 25;
        - a night away in an inn or temple bed nobody holds gives rest to
          100 and 15 on hunger and thirst, under your own bed's and a bed
          you are allowed in's 25;
        - a night on a bedroll or a bed on the road leaves rest at least 50
          and nothing on hunger or thirst; a seat or your feet, nothing;
        - the clock itself (drain, above) stays as he set it on 23 Sep.

      sleptFor is how long away is a night: 8 hours on the game clock, which
      runs twenty times real time, so 24 real minutes. Away for less is no
      night, only the drain. Without it, lying down at home and logging
      straight back in would put 25 on hunger and thirst every time.

    MASTER CARVER'S FIRE (#1398).

    woodworker builds or works are the hottest the warmth rules allow, 48 at
    your feet and still nothing at 300, where any other fire is 34.

    The server cannot see which fire is which: the client says only how far
    the nearest one is. So a fire is a Master Carver's while one is working
    it: a master woodworker who is within reach of a fire, and you within
    reach of them in the same cell. That is the master's own fire, the kiln
    they burn at, and whoever is standing at it with them. Nobody builds a
    fire in this world yet, so working one is the whole of it today.

    The perk is the progression block's own answer, held at master in the
    half somebody picked. Nothing loaded answers no, which is an ordinary fire.

    WHAT THE SERVER THINKS IS ON SOMEBODY, ITEM BY ITEM.

    Patrick, 23 September: "temperature was not right it said the same with
    clothes, without clothes, and with a mix". There are four things that
    produce exactly that and nothing on screen tells them apart: the meter
    being slow, the warmth table resolving nothing, the server holding no
    record of the clothes because they were handed out inside the client's
    own game, or the clothes being worth so little on a mild day that the
    difference is under a degree.

    The first is answered by the Body page on K (it was /needs until #1631)
    saying where the warmth is heading. This answers the other three: every
    worn thing the server can see, whether the table knows it, and what it
    is worth. A piece the server has no record of
    cannot appear here at all, and that absence is the answer in the third
    case: ActionListener::OnUpdateEquipment logs 'dropped N item(s) the
    server has no record of' when the client equips something it was handed
    inside its own game, and those are invisible to everything here.

    Grim's idea and Patrick's yes. Somebody counts as a bard for this when the

    in the last few minutes. There is no bard profession in the rulebook to

    Patrick's.

    PLAYING, NOT SAYING (#1631). This used to be the word /bard, and nothing
    people do is a typed word any more. Patrick's answer on #1631, 4 Oct:
    "instrument emotes require the instrument, so if they do an emote with an
    instrument have that count as /bard, and also add a singing emote for
    people that are only singing". So a bard is somebody whose last animation
    is the emote wheel's Lute, Flute or Drum with that instrument in the pack,
    or its Sing, which needs nothing. The server reads both itself: the
    animation is the engine's lastAnimEvent, the last one the client sent for
    its own character, which the engine clears the moment they move; the
    instrument is the server's own inventory. No line from the client is
    asked or believed. Each tick that sees them playing is the word said
    again, so a bard counts while they play and for BARD_FOR after.

        WHY THE NUMBER IS WHAT IT IS, added 23 September.

        Patrick, in the world: "temp in general isn't working not just with
        fire", after seeing 51 indoors and 53 to 54 outdoors and reading it
        as backwards. The meter moves toward its target by half the distance
        every three minutes, so almost every number anybody ever sees is
        mid-journey, and a number mid-journey with no target beside it is
        indistinguishable from a broken one. 51 indoors was on its way up to
        58 and 53 outdoors was on its way down to 44, which is the system
        working and looks exactly like the system failing.

        So the target travels with the reading, along with the four things
        that set it. Then the next report is a measurement rather than an
        impression, and a real fault is told apart from a slow one in one
        command.

    rule: for somebody who hid the bars and wants a quick text version of
    them. It is another view of what the bars and the Body page on K already
    show, so it says the same things the bars say, with the same words: the
    three meters as a per cent with their band, Temp as its word and number,
    where the warmth is heading, and where they are resting. The working out
    of the warmth and what is counted as worn stay on the Body page, which

    Patrick, 23 September: "I also don't think the different levels are

    He is right and the penalties were never the problem: TEMP_COST and COST
    are real and correct, and effects() adds them up properly. They ride to
    the client on the skills panel, because the client applies every actor
    value in panel.effects and a penalty is a negative number in the same
    map. And the panel is only written when the CHARACTER changes: a rank, a
    class, a point spent.

    Getting cold is not a character change. So somebody could walk from Fine
    into Weary, Bad and Spent and the numbers on their actor never moved,
    because nothing wrote the panel. The whole system was computed every
    twenty seconds and thrown away.

    So a band change asks the character block to redraw. It is the one call
    that exists for exactly this, it already holds back a write that would
    not change anything, and a band change is at most a handful of times an

    ===================== THE FOUR BARS ON SCREEN, AND WHY THEY ARE HERE =====

    Patrick, 22 September: "There is no indicator for the hunger food or
    exhasution on screen", and then "the temp stuff should also have a hud
    element".

    He is right and a meter nobody can see is only a punishment: you start
    missing swings and nothing on the screen says why.

    IT BUILDS ITSELF AND NEEDS NO SHIP. This is an updateOwner script, so it
    travels with the gamemode: deploying the server puts the HUD on everybody
    without a launcher release or a new overlay file. It creates its own
    element in the overlay document and calls into no page, so a client whose
    overlay predates this still draws it.

    EDGE TRIGGERED ON A SIGNATURE, not on the raw value. updateOwner runs
    EVERY FRAME (see the note over SWING_PROPERTY), and these numbers move
    continuously, so a naive script would rebuild the HTML sixty times a
    second forever. The signature is the ROUNDED numbers and the bands, so it
    changes about once a minute and costs one string compare the rest of the
    time.

    QUIET WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY. A bar that is fine is dimmed almost to
    nothing; the HUD only draws attention when something is actually wrong.
    Four bars shouting all the time is four bars nobody reads.
  */
  /*
    THE HTML IS BUILT HERE, NOT IN THE BROWSER, and that is the important
    choice in this function.

    An updateOwner script is JavaScript that runs on the client, so it can do
    the work itself and hand the overlay one finished string. The first
    version built the markup inside a string inside a string, four levels of
    quoting deep, which is unreadable and is exactly where this kind of code
    breaks silently. Now there is one level and JSON.stringify does all of it.

    THE ICONS ARE INLINE SVG for the same reason the HUD builds its own
    element: no file has to be shipped, no path has to resolve, and a client
    that has never seen this before draws it correctly the first time.
  */
  function hudScript() {
    /*
      BIGGER, SOLID, AND ON A BACKING, because the first version could not be
      read.

      Patrick, 23 September, looking at it in a night scene: "the indicators
      are too small and hard to see with the color they are", "that's all
      trasparent", "the water drop icon for water its like purple and not
      blue".

      Three separate mistakes, all mine. The text was 12px with 96px bars. The
      healthy state was drawn at 0.38 opacity, which is almost nothing over a
      dark scene and is where the washed out colours came from: a blue at a
      third opacity over near black is not blue any more. And there was no
      backing at all, so every colour was fighting whatever happened to be
      behind it.

      So: half again the size, a dark panel behind it, and opacity that never
      goes below readable. Quiet is done with COLOUR now, not by fading the
      whole row out, which was the thing that made it unreadable.

      AND HALF AGAIN ON TOP OF THAT. Patrick, looking at the 15px version on
      his own screen, 23 September: "The indicator area is still to small it
      all needs to be like 1.5x the current size". So every measurement in
      here is the 15px one multiplied by 1.5 and rounded: text 22px, bars
      198x16, icons 28px, and the padding and gaps to match. The anchor stays
      where it is, because the panel grows up and to the right from the bottom
      left corner and moving it would only push it into the compass.

      ONE STRIP UNDER THE BARS, SIZED BY THE HUD (#2247). Djinn on dev,
      26 September: "The survival UI box blocks the magicka bar. It needs to
      be resized and moved." It did: four rows of 22px, about 514 by 193
      pixels at 1920x1080 from the bottom left corner, and the bars people
      see sit right there. Measured on 11 Oct from the collection's own
      files, not guessed:

        TrueHUD's player widget is on and hides the game's own three bars
        (Data\MCM\Config\TrueHUD\settings.ini: bEnablePlayerWidget 1,
        bPlayerWidgetHideVanillaBars 1, not combined, bar width 245). Its
        movie is 1280x720 (TrueHUD.swf's header), shown whole and centred
        (BSScaleformManager's default, kShowAll), and TrueHUD places each bar
        at that stage size times the setting (PlayerWidget.cpp LoadConfig,
        TrueHUD_PlayerWidget.as): magicka from x 84.5 to 329.5 centred on
        y 676.8, health centred on x 640, stamina ending at x 1195.5, all at
        y 676.8, and the enchantment charge meter centred on 640, 698.4. A
        bar's frame is 18 high and its flash 19.2 (LargeBarFrame and
        LargeBarOutlineFlashTexture in TrueHUD_Assets0.swf), so nothing of
        the three reaches below y 686.4, and the charge meter starts right
        of x 570.

        SkyHUD's hudmenu (SkyHUD.bsa, meters locked at the game's places,
        skyhud.txt) puts the game's own bars higher, between y 610 and 640
        (magicka x 118 to 411), with nothing of the HUD below 640 on the
        left. Those are what show if TrueHUD's widget is ever off.

      So the bars are one strip of four in the band below all of that: the
      stage's y 698 to 718, from x 10 to 550, which is clear of every bar
      either mod draws and of the charge meter. And every size is in the
      HUD's own pixels, --ts, which is the screen's height over 720 or its
      width over 1280, whichever is smaller (that is what kShowAll does), so
      the strip keeps the same place against the bars at 1280x720, 1080p,
      1440p, 4K, 16:10 and ultrawide. The row's words stay (Hunger, Thirst,
      Rest, Temp), smaller: 10 of the HUD's pixels, 15px at 1080p and 20px at
      1440p. tests\test-hud.js works the strip out at each of those screens
      against the measured bars.

      the same teardrop, one of them upside down. At fourteen pixels they were
      indistinguishable, so Temp genuinely did look like a second water drop.
      The drumstick was three disconnected strokes and read as nothing at all.

      An apple, a droplet, a crescent and a THERMOMETER now: four outlines
      with different silhouettes, which is the only property that matters at
      this size. The thermometer is also the right picture for a reading that
      goes both ways, where a flame could only ever mean hot.

        DRUNK AND HIGH, AN ICON EACH, ONLY WHILE IT APPLIES (#3143).

        Patrick, 22 October, on his report page: "An icon that shows only
        while drunk or high", not a fifth bar. Drunk is the server's own
        answer (NEEDS.ale.drunkFrom, the third ale until a sleep or the 45
        minutes), and high is a drug's window being open (NEEDS.drug, the
        10 minutes skooma or any of the six drugs holds the rest drain at
        zero). Both ride on the needs record, so nothing is worked out here.

        A tankard for drunk and a four point star for high, in their own
        small panel sitting on the strip's left end. It has to sit there:
        the strip's 540 pixels are all used by the four rows (S3d), and the
        corner above the strip's left end, x 10 to 49 and y 679 to 697 of
        the HUD's pixels with both icons up, is left of TrueHUD's magicka
        bar (from x 64.5) and below SkyHUD's (to y 640), so it covers none
        of them. tests\test-hud.js works that out at every screen it knows.
        It is a child of the strip, so taking the strip off in creation takes
        it off too.

    =============== FIRE SPREADING FROM PERSON TO PERSON ====================

    Patrick, 23 September: "when people catch fire it should be able to spread
    to other people if they ade close enough".

    NEITHER END CAN DO THIS ALONE. The client knows it is standing in a fire
    and can set itself alight; it cannot see where anybody else is standing,
    because SkyMP's other people are actors it has no roster for. The server
    knows exactly where everybody is and cannot see a fire at all. So the
    client says "I am burning" over the chat socket, this finds the neighbours,
    and the property below tells their clients to catch.

    THE PROPERTY IS THE ONLY WAY TO REACH A CLIENT. There is no message type
    for "you are on fire", the same way there is none for "your pick broke",
    and an updateOwner script is the one channel that ships with the gamemode
    and needs no launcher release.
