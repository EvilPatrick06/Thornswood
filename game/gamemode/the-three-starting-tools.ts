// province has been told a lie by us and not by the game.
//
// The tool is IN THE PACK and nothing more. Nothing here equips anything: the
// server can write an inventory and cannot make somebody hold a weapon, and
// Patrick asked for unequipped anyway.
//
// Three verbs ask for a tool and no others. Gathering, hunting and fishing do

  The tool each class or profession works with, keyed by the pick that earns it.

  ONE TOOL IS HANDED OVER AND SEVERAL COUNT AS HOLDING IT, and the second half
  of that was missing until 21 September. The first draft asked for one form id
  per tool, which is wrong about this game in a way that bites hardest on the
  farmer: Skyrim ships TWO shovels. Shovel01 and Shovel02 are separate MISC
  records in Skyrim.esm with the same model, the same name in the pack and no
  difference a person can see, and both of them sit side by side in
  LootMiningToolRandom05 and LootToolRandom05. Every record below was read out
  of the load order, and every count was made by walking every GRUP in every
  plugin and counting the placed references that point at it, on 21 September:

    weapPickaxe                   0x0E3C16   WEAP   Skyrim.esm      428 placed
    dunVolunruudPickaxe           0x1019D4   WEAP   Skyrim.esm        1  the Notched Pickaxe
    SSDRocksplinterPickaxe        0x06A707   WEAP   Skyrim.esm        0  Rocksplinter, handed out by a quest
    DLC2AncientNordPickaxe        0x0398E6   WEAP   Dragonborn.esm    1  the one that cuts stalhrim
    DLC2RR03NordPickaxe           0x0206F2   WEAP   Dragonborn.esm    1
    DLC2dunKolbjornRalisPickaxe   0x179C9    WEAP   Dragonborn.esm    0
    Axe01                         0x02F2F4   WEAP   Skyrim.esm      287 placed, the woodcutter's axe
    Shovel01                      0x0F5D05   MISC   Skyrim.esm      338 placed
    Shovel02                      0x0F5D06   MISC   Skyrim.esm      112 placed

  So 112 of the 450 shovels lying about the province are the one the first draft
  refused, and a farmer who lost the shovel they were handed, walked to a mill
  and picked up the shovel leaning on the wall had a one in four chance of being
  told they need a shovel while carrying one, which is a hard refusal with no
  way out of it. Measured in the harness rather than worked out: toollens.js
  case G.

  The pickaxes are the same shape of problem with smaller numbers. Three of the
  six are quest items somebody may well be carrying and nothing else, and the
  Notched Pickaxe in particular is a thing people go and fetch on purpose. All
  six mine, so all six count.

  WHAT IS NOT IN THE LISTS. The war picks out of Immersive Weapons, IWSteelWar-
  Pick and the three beside it, are weapons shaped like a pick and are not mining
  tools; nothing in the game lets one work a seam and neither does this. And the
  woodcutter's axe has an accept list of one because there is only one: the whole
  load order, masters and all 96 plugins after them, was searched for another
  woodcutter's axe on 21 September and Axe01 is alone.

  The other farm tool in the masters is Pitchfork001, 0x0F5D07, also a MISC in
  Skyrim.esm. It is named here so that the next person to ask why the farmer
  carries a shovel can see that the other candidate was looked at and put aside:
  a pitchfork moves hay and a shovel turns ground, and turning ground is what
  the hoe was going to be for. Nothing hands a pitchfork out and nothing asks
  for one.

    give    the descriptor a handout adds. One of them, the common one.
    accept  every descriptor that counts as holding the tool, the given one
            first. holdsTool reads this and nothing else.
    name    what a sentence calls it. aWord puts 'a' or 'an' in front of it.
    where   where to get another, said in the refusal, because 'you need a
            pickaxe' with no second sentence sends somebody to the Discord.
    broken  where to get another when the one they had just snapped, which is
            not the same sentence. Patrick, 21 September: a broken tool is
            replaced by "a smith making them", so the smith is named first and
            the world is named second. Both are true and the order is the
            point: the trade is meant to be the way back.

    THE BENCH TRADES' TOOLS (#3162). Patrick's A on his report page, 22 October
    2026: each bench trade needs its own tool, worn out after 50 uses like a
    gathering tool. Keyed by the profession, which is the owner a recipe row
    names, so benchToolKey reads the key straight off the row. The woodworker
    already has one, the woodcutter's axe above, and it is the tool of their
    bench work as well: one tool per trade.

    Which item each is, read out of Skyrim's masters on the box with
    scripts\dev\List-ToolRecords.py on 26 October 2026. The smith's hammer and
    the cook's ladle are Skyrim's own MISC records, BlacksmithHammer01 and
    WoodenLadle01. Skyrim has no tailor's shears, alembic or enchanter's
    blade a person could carry under a name that fits, so those three are
    Thornswood-Content.esp's own, each wearing the model of a Skyrim item that
    has one: the shears RuinsScissor01's, the alembic Tolfdir's Alembic's, the
    rune knife RuinsScalpel01's (scripts\mods\Add-ContentRecords.py). None of
    them is in the world: floor items are switched off (#3077) and containers
    start empty (#3078), so a crafter or the pick is the only way to one.

    The geode work at the Winterhold Enchanter asks toolGate(actor,
    'enchanter') and always has (docs/systems/merchant-geode-work.md: the
    Enchanter's tool rules apply), so it asks for the rune knife from now on.

/*
  HOW MUCH WORK A TOOL HAS IN IT BEFORE IT BREAKS. NOT IN THE RULEBOOK.

  Patrick, 21 September: axes, pickaxes and shovels "can eventually break and
  you have to get a new one from a smith making them". So a tool stops being a
  thing somebody owns once and becomes stock, which somebody has to make.

  FIFTY USES, the plan's number: classes.md "It has 50 uses", and the miner,
  farmer, woodworker and fisher pages say the same (#1381). The pull request
  that closed #1381 changed only README.md, so the server kept 100 until
  #1588. The pick, the axe, the shovel and the pole all have 50, and so does
  the tool handed at creation, because handTool starts no count of its own:
  wearTool counts every one of them against this. A tool that was already
  past 49 uses under the old hundred breaks at its next one, because it has
  done its 50.

  It was a hundred first, measured against the ladder when TUNING.workPerRank
  added up to 20 + 50 + 120 = 190 yields from novice to Master: two tools to
  the top. The ladder is 100 + 250 + 600 = 950 now, changed on 21 September
  when a rank stopped meaning twenty seams and started meaning one, so the
  climb costs about nineteen tools. If the tool starts feeling like a toll
  rather than stock, that is a question for the plan pages, not this line.

  The warning comes at fifteen left. Far enough out to finish what you are doing
  and walk to a town, short enough to mean something.

  A use is counted after the work, never before it, so a refused swing costs
  nothing. Nothing here can take a tool somebody is not holding: if the pack
  cannot be read, or the tool is not in it, the swing wears nothing rather than
  breaking something at random.

  TWO READS ANSWER YES RATHER THAN NO, and both are deliberate. A tool none of

  seam. The same choice classGate makes when the character block is missing.

  A descriptor that resolves to 0 on its own is passed over rather than treated
  as the whole tool missing. Dragonborn.esm is in this load order and is not in

    the recipes that need one. handTool is left where it is: through giveTool

/*
  ============================ a seam holds twenty, and gives one at a time ===

  Patrick, 21 September, after playing it: "make each quarry have up to 20 ore
  and not skip the animation and the same with chopping where you get an ore
  each time you hit it you know not all at omce so you can stay for a little
  and get a little or stay andd get all 20", with ten minutes to come back for
  iron, gold, corundum and silver and thirty for moonstone, quicksilver,
  orichalcum, ebony and malachite.

  WHAT THIS REPLACES. A seam handed over its whole yield on one press and then
  refused everybody for between ten minutes and four hours. So a seam was a
  vending machine with a long queue: one strike, a pile of ore, and nothing to
  come back to. A deposit is a pile of twenty that anybody may work down one
  swing at a time, and it is the same seam for whoever is standing there, so
  two miners share a vein rather than each having their own.

  AND THE ANIMATION IS NOT CANCELLED. Every branch of the activate chain ends
  at `return false`, which blocks the engine's own handover, and for a seam
  that is what threw the mining animation away. Mining answers ALLOW now, which
  says "I have handled the yield, let the press go on being a press", and the
  chain returns undefined for it.

  THE POOL LIVES ON THE REFERENCE, not on the person, because a seam is worked
  out for everybody or for nobody. It is written with the reference's own
  property, the same way the spoils block marks a container it has emptied.

  ==================== A PLANT THAT GAVE SOMETHING LOOKS PICKED ============

  #3080. Patrick, 21 October: "instead of replinishing things people can't
  pickup to just block the pickup animation to begin with so that it doesnt
  need to pick it back up".

  The engine fork's client blocks activation on Flora and Tree now
  (objectReferenceEx.ts, dealWithRef), the way it already blocked containers,
  items and doors. A press on a plant, a tree, a fish, hanging game, a nest, a
  churn or a hive only sends the activation: the presser's own Skyrim no
  longer picks it first. So a refused press changes nothing on their machine,
  and there is nothing to put back. That is what the put-back property,
  putBack() and its four second timer were for, and they are gone.

  An ALLOWED press is answered here, as before: the branch hands the produce
  over itself and answers false, so the engine never runs its own pick. The
  one thing the presser's game no longer does for itself is empty the plant,
  so the server tells it to, the way the engine's own model sync shows a
  harvested plant (ModelApplyUtils.applyModelIsHarvested in the fork:
  setHarvested, then the reference off and on again so the model follows).
  On the presser's machine only, because that is the machine that used to
  pick it: a nest, a churn and a hive wait per person (cooldownLeft), so
  emptying them for everybody would show a nest empty to somebody who may
  still take from it.

  WHICH PRESS GAVE SOMETHING is read off the presser's pack, not off the
  sentence: the press is on a FLOR or TREE record and some entry in the pack
  went up while it was answered (answerFlora, under mp.onActivate). Every
  branch that hands produce over, the quests' orchard and scarce water
  included, goes through one place that way, and a press that took something
  without giving (sowing a plot) leaves the plot as it is.

  The order is cleared at every login (the per-session hook in the chargen
  tick), so a pick from an earlier session never empties a plant again.

  THE ONE WAY TO PUT SOMETHING IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY'S EYES.

  before you get kciked from the server incase people miss the message in
  chat", and about the meters: "There is no indicator for the hunger food or
  exhasution on screen".

  Both are the same missing thing. Everything this server says lands in the
  chat overlay, which is a small panel somebody may have scrolled away from or
  simply not be looking at, and the two messages that must not be missed are
  the one that ends in being thrown out and the one that says why you have
  started missing your swings.

  IT DRAWS ITSELF, WITH NO PAGE TO DEPEND ON. The script below builds its own
  element in the overlay document. It does not call into thornswood-chat or
  any other page, so it works on a client whose overlay is from before this
  existed, and it needs no Ship: an updateOwner script travels with the
  gamemode, so a deploy is enough to put a HUD on everybody's screen.

  down had nothing to do with anything.

  This is when the yield happens now. It is a number and not a measurement,
  and saying so is the point: the strike inside IdlePickaxeEnter is an
  annotation in the animation and the server cannot see annotations. The only
  thing on either machine that can is the sendAnimationEvent hook in
  thornswood-front.js, which is already watching the axe fall at a chopping
  block for exactly this reason and writes down, once each, every event it did
  not recognise. Pointing it at the pickaxe as well turns this constant into
  the real event, and that is its own entry on the list.

  Until then: early in the swing, because a pick comes down at the start of a

      somebody who walked up with theirs drawn does not end up swinging two.
      Silently, and without preventing removal, so nothing here can trap

  Patrick, in the world on 23 September: "I just mines it's not doing one
  animation with multiple swings it's doing it one at a time and you have to
  keep clicking".

  He is describing vanilla, and vanilla is right: you activate a seam, your
  character works it, and you walk away when you have had enough. One press
  one swing is a clicking game.

  A SESSION IS A STAMP AND NOTHING ELSE. The person is the key, the stamp is
  what tells one spell of mining from the next, and every swing checks that
  the stamp it started under is still the one on the person. Anything that
  wants it stopped clears the entry; the swing in the air finishes and no
  other follows it. Nothing has to be cancelled, which matters because the
  swing itself is a timer on the client and cannot be taken back.

  WHAT STOPS IT, and each of these is a case somebody hit:
    - pressing again, which is how vanilla stops too
    - the seam running out, which already says so
    - the tool breaking, because the next swing has no pick behind it
    - walking away from the seam, measured rather than assumed
    - logging out, since nobody is there to swing
    - MINE_MOST swings, which is a hard stop under any circumstances

  THE CHANCE OF ONE MORE. docs/systems/classes/miner.md, issue #1380.

  A swing takes 1 ore of its seam and has a chance of one more. The chance
  grows with the rank, and from advanced the extra can be the next tier up,
  from expert two tiers up. One roll decides it, the three chances laid end to
  end, so a swing never drops more than one extra:

    rank      same ore   next tier   two tiers up
    novice    5%
    advanced  10%        2%

    master    20%        8%          2%

  The tiers are iron, clay and quarried stone; then corundum, silver,
  orichalcum and quicksilver; then gold, moonstone and malachite. Inside a tier
  each name is an equal chance. Ebony, the gems, stalhrim and heart stone are
  never an extra, so a roll that would go past the third tier gives nothing,
  and the same-ore roll still stands. Shellbug chitin is in no tier: its own
  seam can give a second one, and no other seam ever gives it.

  The extra comes out of the same seam of twenty, so a seam still holds twenty
  ore in all, and it is the same swing and the same one piece of work.

    swing() was added above when that turned out not to have brought one back.
    The note at SWING_PROPERTY says why it could not have: a vein's animation
    is MineOreScript's and no Papyrus object script runs here, so for an ACTI
    vein ALLOW hands the press to an engine that does nothing with it.

    For a vein that is a FURN record it is not nothing. The table is built out
    of the ACTI AND FURN records carrying MineOreScript, and furniture does not
    need Papyrus: the press puts the person into Skyrim's own mining furniture,
    which is the second animation, the one that holds a real pickaxe, and a
    second way to be stuck standing at a seam. Two patches for one symptom,
    both left in.

    The swing above is the one that works at all 581 seams, ACTI and FURN

  THE CHOPPING BLOCKS. THE WOODWRIGHT'S VERB, AND THE ONLY ONE THEY HAVE.

  Patrick, 21 September, correcting an earlier attempt of mine that overrode all
  three of these records into crafting benches: "The chopping block shouldn't be
  a bench just for getting the firewood and not usable by non woodworkers and
  also have the animation script". So the plugin does not touch them at all, the
  records stay Bethesda's, and the whole of this is server side.

  THE THREE RECORDS, read out of Skyrim.esm on 21 September rather than
  remembered. All three are FURN with WBDT 00ff, which is 'not a bench', which is
  why standing at one has never opened anything:

    0x07022E  WoodChoppingBlock          the common one
    0x0A91BF  WoodChoppingBlockSnow      the same block in the snow regions
    0x10F575  WoodChoppingBlockCOPY0000  a stray duplicate, and the one that is
                                         missing FurnitureWoodChoppingBlock

  AND A FOURTH, IN Dragonborn.esm, added 24 September:

    0x03828B  DLC2WoodChoppingBlockAsh   Solstheim's, three placed, all in
                                         DLC2SolstheimWorld

  The chopping blocks fix of 24 September read every placed block in the load
  order and found this base missing here, so the three on Solstheim were
  outside the Woodwright rules: a press fell through every branch of the
  activate chain to loot(), which answers nothing for a thing that is not an
  actor, and the engine sat whoever pressed it down to swing, whatever their
  trade, while chopWood never ran and no Woodwright was paid. Read out of the
  plugins the same day (C:\Thornswood\Game\Data and the profile's plugins.txt,
  last one wins, nothing overrides it): the same model as WoodChoppingBlock,
  the same three keywords including FurnitureWoodChoppingBlock, the same WBDT
  00ff, the same markers and the same ResourceFurnitureScript. It is the common
  block with ash on it.

  All four are here because a person cannot tell one chopping block from
  another, which is the same reason TOOLS.farmer accepts both shovels.

  WHY IT IS THE WOODWRIGHT'S AND NOT THE WOODWORKER'S. The kiln gates on
  'charburner' and a Woodwright gets its novice grade for nothing, because 'you
  get the novice work of your sister half for nothing'. This is that rule the
  other way round: the block is the Woodwright's and a Charburner may chop at
  novice. Until today the Woodwright had no verb and no bench in the entire load
  order, so half of the Woodworker was a title with nothing behind it.

  WHO IS STANDING AT WHICH BLOCK, AND WHEN THEY LAST PRESSED IT.

  Patrick, 21 September: "the chopping block is still not always doing the
  animation and not always giving the wood apon hit still".

  The server sees a PRESS. The block is a FURN record, so pressing it puts the
  person into Skyrim's own chopping furniture and the axe falls over and over
  while the server hears nothing at all, and vanilla's own block script, which
  would have handed wood over per swing, does not run here any more than
  MineOreScript does. So one press was one handover and everything after it was
  a person swinging an axe at a server that had stopped listening.

  The client can see each swing, because the animation events pass through it.
  It reports them on the one channel that exists, the chat overlay's socket,
  as /chopped. That channel is a chat line, so anybody could type the word, and
  this is what stops that being worth anything: a /chopped is only credited to
  somebody the server has just watched press a chopping block, and no faster
  than an axe can actually fall.

  ============ THREE BLOCKS THAT ARE NOT OURS TO WORK, BY WHERE THEY STAND ===

  Djinn, 22 September, in "Removal from area - Woodworking chopping Blocks":

    Solitude:          -64263, 106003.5, -8377.8

    Dragon Bridge:     -101780.7, 80484.5, -12522.7

  BY POSITION, BECAUSE THE BASE IS SHARED. CHOPPING_BLOCKS is four BASE
  records and every block in Skyrim is one of them, so there is no way to name
  one block without naming all of them. A placed reference cannot be deleted
  from here either: that is a change to a plugin, which is a rebuild and a
  pack and a server that will not start if it goes wrong. A place is something
  this file can hold, the same way a notice board is a place, and it costs one
  distance check on a press that was going to do work anyway.

  THE RADIUS IS GENEROUS ON PURPOSE. 300 units is about two paces wider than a
  block and its stump, and the nearest block Djinn did not name is a hold away
  from any of these, so there is nothing for it to catch by accident.

  WHAT A PRESS DOES NOW: nothing, and it says so once. The activate chain
  blocks the handover, so Skyrim's own furniture does not start either and
  nobody is left swinging at a block that pays nothing.

    THE YIELD. It was randInt(1, 2 + step), so a novice got one or two and it
    changed every time. Two, flat, per split. A rank still matters because a
    higher rank splits are not what this measures; the rank shows up in what the

  THE KILN IS A BENCH, AND A PRESS ON IT IS THE ENGINE'S (#2337).

  Until 12 Oct a press on the charcoal kiln was answered here by a function
  that burned three firewood into one grade of charcoal on a second press
  inside fifteen seconds. It was written on 21 September because the kiln's
  crafting menu had nothing in it, and its own comment said so: four charcoal
  recipe records "would turn this into an ordinary bench with an ordinary menu
  and delete" it, which was "the right end state". Patrick's report that day
  was "it's making charcoal automatically instantly upon opening the kiln and
  not when you click to make it".

  The plugin carries those four recipes now, and the Tool Handle and the
  Splint, all six on the kiln's keyword. So the press answer had become the
  fault: onActivate answered every kiln press with a line and false, which
  skips ProcessActivateNormal, the engine step that seats a person at a FURN
  and opens its menu for them; and on the client, where furniture is not
  blocked, opening the menu twice inside the window burned three firewood
  nobody asked to spend. Nothing here answers a kiln press now. benchGate
  still refuses it to anybody who is not a woodworker, and the menu's rows go
  through mp.onCraft like every other bench: the half and rank on each row,
  the fit-to-make gate, and the work counted. tests/test-2337-kiln-menu.js
  holds it.
