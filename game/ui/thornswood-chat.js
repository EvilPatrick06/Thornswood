/*
  The chat's connection, page side.

  Where the messages actually travel, and why here rather than through the game
  server: the voice service already relays them. It has since it was written.
  Look at the socket handler in voice-server.js:

      if (msg.t === 'chat') {
        ...
        for (const [, p] of peers) p.ws.send(out);
      }

  Everyone with the game open already holds that socket, the service already
  knows who they are, and it is plain JavaScript on the VPS that can be changed
  without recompiling anything. Going through the game server instead would
  mean a new packet type in skymp5-client, and skymp5-client is compiled.

  It runs in the page rather than in a plugin because the browser is where a
  WebSocket exists. SkyrimPlatform's own HttpClient can only poll.

  The page is served from file:///, which Chromium treats as a trustworthy
  origin, so it may open sockets anywhere. It opens only wss:// to the
  address the launcher gives it, since the join token goes with the handshake
  and the service refuses one over plain ws (#1304).

  /*
    WHAT VOICE MISSED BEFORE IT GOT ON (#1869).

    Nothing orders this socket joining the room against the game's voice
    overlay getting on it. The socket joins as soon as it has a token: at
    the character choice, for somebody waiting in line (#481, #1142), and
    otherwise whenever the launcher hands one over. The overlay gets on when
    the voice plugin first configures it, about two seconds after the
    overlays go in. The service sends the roster when somebody joins or
    leaves and at no other time, and everybody already in the room builds a
    connection to this one off that roster and sends its offer at once.
    Whatever came before voice was listening went to fanout and so nowhere:
    the overlay had nobody to open until the next join or leave, and then
    its own offer met a peer still waiting on the answer to the one it had
    sent, which the impolite side of a pair ignores. Neither ever answered
    the other. tests/test-1869-voice-negotiation.js runs both pages through
    the real service in that order.

    So until voice gets on (board, below), the newest roster and the offers
    and candidates sent to this connection are kept, and board hands them
    over in that order before anything new. The service always writes the
    roster that names somebody before anything they send here, so the
    overlay opens a peer before it hears from them, as it does live. A newer
    roster replaces the old one, and what is kept from somebody it no longer
    names goes, because they left and their peer id is never handed out
    again. A new connection starts with nothing kept: the room offers to its
    new peer id. Once voice is on, nothing is kept: it hears everything from
    then on, across reconnects, relay mode included, where it reads the
    positions and drops the signalling (#1959).

    A connection gathers a handful of candidates and sends one offer before
    it hears an answer, so a hundred from one peer is not a connection
    being made. Nothing more from that peer is kept, and the log says so
    once.

    THE POSITION VIEW, THE MODES AND THE SILENCES TOO (#1924). The service
    sends a connection its whole view once, { t: 'pos' } on the first tick
    after it joins, and from then on only the rows that changed
    ({ t: 'moved' }, the note over the tick in voice/voice-server.js). So
    an overlay that got on after that first tick never held anybody
    standing still, itself included: no speaking marks until it moved, the
    party strip reading the same empty table, and nobody placed in its own
    mesh. So the view is kept as
    the overlay would have kept it, the last whole one with every change
    since applied, and board hands it over as one whole view. A mode said
    since the newest roster is written onto that roster, for everybody on
    the speaker's profile, as the service does for the next roster it
    sends. A staff silence is kept until it is lifted, since it is told to
    every connection once and the rows carry it only when they change. Each
    of these replaces what it says rather than adding to it, so none of
    them grows.
