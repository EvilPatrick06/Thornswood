/*
  Thornswood proximity voice, in the game's own browser.

  The earlier build opened Chrome in a window beside the game. That could never
  have worked, for a reason that has nothing to do with the bugs in it: it was
  served from http://<address>:7778, and Chromium exposes the microphone only
  on https or on localhost. On a plain http remote address
  navigator.mediaDevices is not merely blocked, it is undefined. No flag passed
  on the command line changes that, because it is an origin rule, not a
  permission.

  A page loaded from file:// inside the game is a trustworthy origin by
  Chromium's own rule, so the microphone API exists here. Whether CEF hands
  over an actual device is a separate question, answered by the probe.

  Everything this file needs comes from the plugin, never from the page's own
  address, because file:// has no host to read a server out of, and never from
  the keyboard, because the game's browser does not hold focus while you play.
  Push to talk is a game key that the plugin forwards.

  The socket belongs to thornswood-chat.js. This file used to open a second one
  to the same service, which is worse than wasteful: the service hands out a
  peer id per connection, so one person showed up in the room twice, negotiated
  with themselves, and saw every line of chat written out twice. So chat owns
  the connection and this subscribes to it.

    HOW LOUD SOMEBODY IS AT A GIVEN DISTANCE, worked out here rather than left
    to the panner.

    THE PANNER CANNOT DO IT, and that is the whole of this defect. The three
    modes were applied by setting refDistance and maxDistance on a panner whose
    distanceModel is 'inverse', and WEBAUDIO'S INVERSE MODEL DOES NOT READ
    maxDistance AT ALL. Only the linear model does. So the number changed with
    every mode and the only thing that actually differed was refDistance: there
    was no cut off anywhere, a whisper never stopped being audible, and a yell
    was not meaningfully louder than a whisper at the same distance. It is on
    the To Do List as "Whisper, local and yell all carry the same distance,
    because the page changes a number WebAudio does not read", found 19
    September against the launcher's old page; the overlay that replaced that
    page inherited it.

    So the panner is told to apply no distance attenuation of its own,
    rolloffFactor 0, which makes the inverse model return exactly 1 at every
    distance. It keeps HRTF, so direction still works, and the level comes
    from here.

    THE SHAPE. Full strength out to ref, then a natural 1/d falloff scaled so
    it reaches exactly nothing at max rather than trailing off for ever. And a
    per mode weight on top, so a yell IS louder than a whisper standing in the
    same place, which is what anybody would expect and what the old
    arrangement could not express at all.

    ones, they cannot, and that pair of people never hear each other while

    be typed into a page, so the service hands the list out.

    It comes on every roster (#1821), the moment this page builds its
    connections, over the socket its join token proved, so the relay comes
    with it when one is set. It used to be a POST to /ice with the token the
    connection was opened with, and that token is good for two minutes: for
    the rest of a session this page was handed STUN only. Nothing here holds
    a token now.

    The old value stays here until the first roster, so a service that has
    not been told about a relay behaves exactly as this did before.
