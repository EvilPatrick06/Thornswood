  What the front expects, and what this browser actually has.

  The front is built against skymp's own client, which sets up a richer window
  than SkyrimPlatform does. In this build the bridge object is created in
  ProcessHandler.cpp and it carries exactly one thing:

      window.skyrimPlatform = { sendMessage: function () {} }

  Four gaps follow from that, and all four are silent.

  1. window.skymp, with .send for talking outward and .on for hearing back,
     does not exist. The front guards that one, so it fails quietly.

  2. window.chatMessages does not exist. The chat draws its list straight off
     that global rather than off its own props, so the first render throws.

  3. Nothing ever renders. App only draws the chat when it is "loggined", and
     nothing in the front ever sets that, so the real path is the widget list:
     the game pushes a list of things to draw and Constructor draws them.

  4. The chat widget's `send` has to be a function. Chat does

         if (send !== undefined) { send(message); }

     with no type check, so a string there is a silent throw inside a React
     callback and the box eats what you typed.

  And one thing that is not a gap in the front but a fact about the browser,
  which is the reason half of this file exists:

      While the browser holds the keyboard, no plugin can see a key.

  browser.setFocused(true) raises DInputHook::ChromeFocus, which withholds
  DirectInput from the game, and SkyrimPlatform's buttonEvent is built out of
  the game's own input. So the moment focus goes up, every plugin goes deaf,
  including the one that put focus up. CEF still gets keys, through a Windows
  raw input hook that does not care about any of this.

  That is why escape is handled here and answered back over sendMessage rather
  than being waited for on the game side. A plugin waiting for a key it cannot
  receive is somebody standing in Windhelm unable to move.

    THE CHAT GETS OUT OF THE WAY.

    Patrick, 24 September: "can you make the default for the chat to hide
    after 10 seconds if the server sends a message or someone else or if you
    do and it come back when you hit enter and add an option in the launcher
    settings to make it 5, 10, 15, 20 or permeant like it is now."

    Every line goes through thornswoodChat.add, whoever it came from, so a
    line puts the chat back and starts the clock again. Enter goes through
    focusInput, which puts it back and stops the clock while the box is open;
    blurInput starts the clock again when the line is sent or Escape shuts it.

    The number is the launcher's Settings, ChatFade in Thornswood.ini, which
    thornswood-front.js hands over as window.THORNSWOOD.chatFade. 0 is how it
    was before, on screen all the time. It is read each time rather than once
    because that object goes in after this page has loaded.

    The class goes on <html>, not on #chat: React owns #chat and a redraw
    could take a class back off it, and nothing owns <html>.
