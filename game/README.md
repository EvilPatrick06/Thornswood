# The game

## What it is

Everything that runs in the game or on the game server, as opposed to the
scripts that build and ship it:

- `gamemode.js`: the server's gamemode, one file of node that the SkyMP
  server loads. `Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1` puts it on the dev server, and
  `Deploy-Gamemode.ps1` then `Deploy-Server.ps1` on the live one.
- `plugins\`: the Skyrim Platform plugins that run in each person's game.
  Its own README says how they are written.
- `ui\`: the overlays and the page the plugins draw in the game's browser.
  Its own README too.
- `data\`: the tables the gamemode's generated blocks are built from (doors,
  fires, food, harvests, hunts, ores, races, recipes, spells, stations,
  warmth, water, weather, cast, the mine buildings, plus `data.json`,
  `items.json` and `chargen.json` for the one-line `DATA` / `ITEMS` / `CHARGEN`
  consts). The `Build-*Table` scripts in `scripts\dev\` and
  `Install-GamemodeConsts.js` read these and write the matching block or const
  line in `gamemode.js`; nothing reads them at run time.
- `content\Thornswood-Content.esp`: our plugin file. People get it through
  the Nexus collection; the dev and live deploys send it to the server.
- `content\Thornswood-Last.esp`: the light plugin that loads last (#2468).
  It switches off every placed actor the NPC catalogue cuts and stops every
  vanilla quest from starting, except the ones
  `data\last-plugin-policy.json` keeps while Patrick decides. Built only by
  `scripts\mods\Build-LastPlugin.py` from the installed load order, never in
  an editor; `data\last-plugin.json` is what it holds, and
  `tests\test-2468-last-plugin.js` holds the two together. It reaches people
  and the servers through the Nexus collection, enabled and sorted last, so
  a rebuild needs a collection revision.
- `required-data\`: plugins the load order names that Vortex does not yet
  deploy under that exact filename. Go.ps1 and Ship place them into `Data\`.
  Its own README says when to take one out.
- `menu\`: the two logo meshes and the wallpaper behind Skyrim's main menu,
  which `Go.ps1` copies into the game folder.
- `ours\`: the main menu with no Bethesda logo, the empty loading spinner,
  the silent stand-in for the game's theme, and SkyHUD's settings. Each
  file keeps its path under `Data\`, beside `menu\`, and `Go.ps1` copies
  that path into the game folder.

## On your machine

`.\scripts\release\Go.ps1 -SkipServer` copies the plugins, the overlays, the menu
and our menu files into the game folder, which is how a change here reaches your own game.
Every harness in `tests\` that checks the gamemode reads `gamemode.js` from
here.

## Where it runs

The plugins, the overlays and the menu go out in the release packs; the
gamemode and the content plugin go to the server. Moved here from `tools\`
on 25 September (issue #440, phase 6); the comments inside these files still
say `tools\` in places, because changing them would change what ships.
