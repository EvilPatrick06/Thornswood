  THE FREE SKYRIM TRADING COMPANY: ITS TERMS (#512).

  The company is Skyrim's hauler and a business (docs/systems/trading-company.md,
  #1393, #1646). Its hauls, its tenth and its sales out of the world are in the
  property block of gamemode.js. This file is the company's terms as data staff
  can change, and the arithmetic that reads them. It never touches the world, a
  pack, a ledger, a purse or a price, and it is not wired in yet: the design and
  Patrick's questions are on #512 (issuecomment-6245906394).

  THE TERMS are one object, kept in game/data/trading-company.json:

    haulFee            gold a haul costs to post, on top of its pay
    haulCutPercent     the company's cut of a delivered haul's pay, in whole percent
    haulCutFrom        a pay under this keeps no cut, and the hauler gets it all
    saleWorkerPercent  on a sale out of the world, the worker's percent
    saleGonePercent    on a sale out of the world, the percent that leaves the server
    saleCutFrom        a price under this takes neither cut
    charter            who may charter a trade ship hold (#511): 'company', 'anyone' or 'staff'
    freightPerLoad     gold one load into a ship hold costs; 0 is no freight
    freightTo          where freight goes: 'ledger' (the loading hold's) or 'gone'

  The file's numbers are today's numbers in gamemode.js, and
  tests/test-512-trading-company.js fails the day the two differ.

  WHAT IT REFUSES. Terms that do not check are refused, never replaced with a
  default: a negative fee, a percent outside 0 to 100, two sale cuts over 100,
  an unknown or missing key. A server that silently fell back would charge
  people a number nobody chose.

  THE SERVER PROPOSES, STAFF CONFIRM (Patrick, 17 Oct 2026, 10:13 PM MT).
  proposeTerms() says what would change and how many open hauls keep the terms
  they were posted under. It changes nothing. adoptTerms() is the confirm, and
  it refuses a proposal made against terms that have changed since.

  A HAUL KEEPS ITS TERMS. stampHaul() writes the cut a haul was posted under
  onto the haul, and haulCut() reads that stamp before the current terms, so a
  haul already on the road is paid the way it was posted.

  WHAT IT NEVER DECIDES. Who hauls, for whom, between which holds, when or for
  how long: those are the players' RP. Nothing here names a person, a hold, a
  port, a time or a length.
