// Why this can be a standalone plugin at all, rather than something welded into
// the SkyMP client: an arbitrary animation name triggered locally does reach
// everybody else. The whole chain takes any string.
//
//   send    AnimationSource hooks sendAnimationEvent and forwards whatever name
//           comes through, minus a short ignore list and a rename of anything
//           containing 'equip'. No whitelist.  (sync/animation.ts:258-285)
//   server  MpActor::SetLastAnimEvent stores it as-is. The only validator,
//           IsValidAnimEventName, guards the gamemode's JSON property, not the
//           relay.                                (MpActor.cpp:905-930)
//   receive applyAnimation calls Debug.sendAnimationEvent with the name it was
//           given. allowedAnims only ever gates *attack* animations on refs with
//           default anims disabled.               (sync/animation.ts:122-199)
//
// So: press the key, play the idle locally, and the client's own hook carries it
// to the server and out to the other four. Nothing here talks to the server
// directly and nothing here needs the gamemode to know it exists.
//
// Three names to avoid, from that same send path: anything containing 'equip'
// is rewritten to SkympFakeEquip, and SneakStart/SneakStop are swallowed
// outright. Every name in the table below but Sing's (see EMOTES) was read out
// of an IDLE record's ENAM field in this setup's own Skyrim.esm and
// Dragonborn.esm, and none of them trip those rules.
//
// What changed: this used to call browser.loadUrl on a page of its own. There
// is one browser, so that threw away whatever was in it, which was the chat and
// the names above heads, and it always called last so it always won. The wheel
// is an overlay inside the front now (Data/Platform/UI/thornswood-emotes.js)
// and this file no longer loads a page, sets visibility, or sets focus. The
// front owns all three; focus is borrowed by name while the wheel is up.

/**
 * The letter a scan code prints, so the page can swallow the key that opened
 * the wheel instead of typing it into whatever has focus.
 *
 * While the wheel is up it holds browser focus, and no key press reaches this
 * file as a buttonEvent. DInputHook::GetDeviceData in the fork does read the
 * keyboard and call ProcessKeyboardData whoever has focus, but that feeds
 * OnKeyStateChange in the fork's main.cpp, which returns unless the browser
 * has focus and then only injects the key into the page. buttonEvent comes
 * from the game's own input events, and with focus up the game's buffer gets
 * no key downs; since #898 it gets only the key up of a key it already held
 * (HeldKeyRelease), so nothing stays held. thornswood-front.js measured the
 * same and gives the code path, in its note on typing over wantTyping.
 *
 * So with the wheel up only the page hears a key, and the page closes it on
 * this letter, on CLOSE_KEY's letter and on Escape by sending __close
 * (#1852). The branches of the keys handler below that shut an open wheel on
 * OPEN_KEY or CLOSE_KEY are reached only while the wheel is drawn without the
 * keyboard, which is the front's two minute cap taking the claim back. This
 * comment used to say the opposite, that buttonEvent keeps arriving the whole
 * time the wheel is up (#1675).
 *
 * An earlier page closed the wheel on this letter too, and a log of
 * 25 September has one tap opening the wheel and shutting it again before it
 * was drawn. The client records/client-build.json names (fork 0460584e)
 * cannot do that. ProcessKeyboardData compares every keyboard snapshot with
 * the last one whoever has focus, and OnKeyStateChange hands the page a
 * change only while the browser has focus. The snapshot is read in the same
 * GetDeviceData call that hands the game the key going down (the game's
 * buffer is read first and the snapshot right after it), or in an earlier
 * call. So by the time this file hears the press and the wheel takes the
 * keyboard, the snapshot already has the key down, or missed a tap that
 * quick altogether, and the page hears at most the key coming up.
 * tests/test-1852-wheel-keys.js plays that path through.
