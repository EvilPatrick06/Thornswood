// Thornswood: mark this spot.
//
// The arrival coordinates for the nine starting inns were first written by
// hand, each one the inn's front door moved 110 units along the door's own
// heading, and seven of those eight were not in the room. 1.1.41 walked five;
// Solitude, Falkreath and Dawnstar now use the spot the game puts you on when
// you walk in the front door (the comment above CHARGEN in gamemode.js says
// how). The old Morthal and Dawnstar points only looked like one spot because
// the two inns share a layout: interior coordinates belong to their own cell.
//
// So a spot gets measured rather than typed. Stand where somebody should
// arrive, face the way they should face, press the key. This writes the cell,
// the position and the angle out of the running game, and Mark-Spot.ps1 turns
// the file into the line the content table wants.
//
// Nothing here touches anything. It reads three values and appends a line.

// ------------------------------------------------------------ whose game ----
// thornswood-front.js owns the whose-game check (issue #485): the client
// settings must point at this server and the launcher's session note must be
// fresh, or every Thornswood plugin stays idle. Front publishes the check as
// globalThis.Thornswood.whoseGame, and only when it says ours. This plugin
// runs nothing until the first tick: Skyrim Platform runs every file in
// Data/Platform/Plugins in one pass and sends that tick after the pass
// (TickImpl in the fork's skyrim-platform SkyrimPlatform.cpp), so by then
// front has published the check or did not load, whichever order the files
// came in. Nothing published means idle; so does the check saying not ours.

/*
  AND ONLY FOR SOMEBODY THE SITE CALLS A DEV.

  This is internal tooling. It writes coordinates out of the world so the
  arrival points and the notice boards can be measured rather than typed, and
  it has been shipping to every customer bound to an unmodified F8 since it was
  written. Nothing it does is dangerous, but a retail client should not carry a
  developer tool on a function key, and the next one like it might not be
  harmless.

  THE FLAG ALREADY EXISTS AND IS NOT THIS FILE'S TO INVENT. The launcher asks
  the site whether this person may use the dev build, and Discord.cs writes
  Profile\dev-allowed.txt when the answer is yes and DELETES it when the answer
  is no. So the file being there is the site's answer, kept on disk, and it is
  the same answer the dev build itself is gated on.

  Relative to the game folder, because that is where the process stands: the
  paths above are Data/Platform/... for the same reason, and Profile sits
  beside Game rather than inside it. Relative also means the dev build reads
  its own Profile rather than the play install's.

  THE FILE STILL SHIPS, deliberately. Ship refuses a release when the plugin
  folder and the source differ by a byte, and a half done removal stops every
  release, which is what the entry's own trap says. MarkKey stays in the ini
  for the same reason: the ini is not packed, so taking it out would change
  nothing for anybody who already has one. The guard is the fix; the key is
  simply never bound for anybody the site has not named.
