  the browser is free to refuse, and when it refuses it does so silently: the
  promise rejects into an empty catch and the microphone indicator sits on
  LISTENING ONLY all session while voice itself is working.

  The launcher's two files, read off the game's thread.

  Every sp.on('update') handler runs on the game's thread between frames, and
  the two further down used to read with readFileSync there: the status every

  a synchronous open waits on whatever else has the disk, antivirus included,
  and the frame waits with it. To Do List entry 270: "Get the disk off the

  through the libuv loop, which SkyrimPlatform runs once per update (uv_run

  few frames after the ask.
