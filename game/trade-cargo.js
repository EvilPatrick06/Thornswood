/*
  TRADE SHIPS: THE MANIFEST (#511).

  A trade ship is a hold, a container the server places at a dock, that is
  loaded at one port, is away for a voyage, and is emptied at another. This
  file is only the manifest: what is in each hold, whose pack every piece came
  out of, who it is for, and where it went. It never touches the world, a
  pack, a purse or a price. The design, its boundaries and the questions for
  Patrick are on #511 (issuecomment-6245473792).

  WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO, because a cargo worth robbing is a cargo worth making
  out of nothing (the trap #511 names):

  - A piece is written aboard only with the receipt of the debit that already
    took it out of somebody's pack. One receipt loads once.
  - A piece leaves only in two steps. begin() takes it off the hold and holds
    it as pending; finish() records the receipt of the credit that put it into
    exactly one pack or drop box. A pending piece is still counted, so a crash
    between the two steps neither loses it nor pays it twice.
  - Every change runs the audit: for every line, what was loaded equals what
    is aboard plus what is pending plus what went out. A hold never grows.
  - Coin is not cargo. Gold (base 0xF) is refused; freight is #512's rule.
  - Saved state that does not verify is refused. It never starts empty.

  WHO IS NAMED. A person on the manifest is a character, { actor, profile }:
  the character's form id and the profile it is on, the two numbers the
  release list of deleted characters (#2351, #2668) names people by. Never a
  name: what a panel shows is read off the character when it is shown. When
  a character is deleted, reset, wiped or replaced by New-Character,
  release() takes them off: every place they are named becomes null, and
  every piece stays exactly where it was. A line whose recipient is gone
  cannot be delivered or left for them, and one whose loader is gone cannot
  be returned to them; it stays aboard for the world to settle (a piece can
  still be taken, and staff can narrate what became of it).

  WHAT IT NEVER DECIDES. Thornswood is a player-driven RP server (Patrick,
  17 Oct 2026, 10:13 PM MT): a trade ship is a tool, and the players decide
  what happens with it in the world. So nothing here says who sails, where,
  when or for how long. The ports, the routes, their leg times and the crews
  are staff data: checkRoutes() below reads and checks them, and
  proposeRoutes() lists what a change would do so staff can confirm it before
  it is kept. Who may load, and whether opening a hold is a crime, are the
  world's business, not this file's.

  Ownership of who may run a ship, contracts and freight belong to #512 (the
  Free Skyrim Trading Company). Prices, purses and trading belong to #1373.
  Nothing here calls either.

  CARTS ARE THE SAME MANIFEST, DRIVEN (#3158). Patrick, 22 Oct 2026: people
  drive the carts that move goods between holds, and a shipment is lost only
  when people raid it, never by chance. createTradeCargo({ driven: true }) is
  a manifest of carts: a "port" is a cart stop and a "route" a road. Every
  rule above holds the same, and three differ:

  - A cart leaves only with a driver, the character who drives it, kept on
    the journey as sailing.driver. A ship never has one.
  - A cart never arrives on a clock. pullIn() brings it in at its stop when
    its driver is there and the road's least time has passed, or when staff
    bring in one whose driver is gone. arrive() refuses a driven manifest.
  - A driver deleted, reset, wiped or replaced comes off the journey the way
    a loader does; the cart stays on the road for staff to bring in.

  Taking from a cart on the road, the raid, is begin() with how 'taken',
  which this file already allows at sea. Who may raid, and where, is the
  caller's rule (game\trade-carts.js).

/*
  STAFF DATA: THE PORTS, ROUTES AND CREWS.

  Nothing about where ships go is written in code. Staff keep one list:

    { v: 1,
      ports:  [{ key, name, hold, world, pos: [x, y, z], crate: '<ref>' }],
      routes: [{ from, to, minutes, crew: ['<ref>', ...] }] }

  A port is a place a hold can stand: its key, the name people read, the hold
  whose drop box takes what nobody collects, and where it stands. crate is
  the reference of the container already in the world that is its dock
  (Patrick, 18 Oct 2026: a ship at the dock is a crate, with no new plugin;
  #2700): E on it opens the dock, never the container. One crate is one
  port's. A port with no crate yet is on the list with nothing to press. A route is
  one way between two ports with the real minutes a leg takes; the way back is
  its own row, so staff can make it longer, shorter or absent. crew is the
  references of any NPCs or special characters staff have stood up for it;
  empty is a route nobody crews. An empty list is a world with no ships.

  checkRoutes() refuses the whole list on the first thing wrong, so a bad edit
  never half applies. proposeRoutes() compares the list in force with an edit
  and says, line by line, what would change, including the holds a removed
  port or route would strand, so staff confirm it knowing that.

  not have, and that manifest would no longer verify. Where staff write an

  ports, no routes, no holds. A text that is there and does not verify is
  refused whole, never read as empty.
