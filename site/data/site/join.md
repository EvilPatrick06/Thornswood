# How to join

## What you need

**Skyrim Special Edition** on Steam, on any build. The server runs build
**1.6.1170**, and Thornswood keeps that build in a game folder of its own. If
your Steam copy is on another build, the launcher's **Downgrade** button asks
Steam for 1.6.1170's files under your own account and puts them in
Thornswood's folder. Your Steam copy stays on the build it is on. Nothing
comes from anywhere but Steam.

**Anniversary Edition is not required** and never will be. If you own it,
nothing breaks. If you do not, nothing is missing.

**Vortex**, with a free Nexus Mods account. The mods come from a collection on
Nexus, and a collection is a Vortex thing: Mod Organizer cannot install it.

Thornswood leaves the Skyrim you already have alone: you can update it,
verify it and mod it as you like. The launcher builds a game folder of its
own, `C:\Thornswood\Game`, out of your Steam copy and what Vortex put into it,
and after that it only takes Vortex's files from there. The mods and Skyrim's
archives are hard links, which take no extra space, and the launcher checks
the archives before every Play; everything else is Thornswood's own copy. Vortex keeps the mods in a profile of their own, so
switching back to your usual profile and running Purge Mods leaves your own
Skyrim the way it was.

## 1. Apply

**Thornswood is eighteen and over.** Applying is you stating that you are. The
[rules](/rules) say what that is about before they say anything else.

**Thornswood is in alpha, and the world is open by application.** Anyone can
download and install it. Play unlocks once you have applied in the Discord and
been given the Playtester role, so applying is the first thing to do.

Read the [rules](/rules) first. Then come into the Discord, open a ticket in
the applications channel and pick **Apply to be an alpha playtester**. It asks
whether you are eighteen or over, whether you accept the rules, and a few lines
about who you want to play and a bug you have run into. It is not an essay and
nobody is marking it. Your answers, the rules one included, are kept against
your Discord account.

Somebody reads every application and answers it. Once you are accepted, your
Discord account is what lets you in. There is nothing else to sign up for, no
second password, and no form on this site.

You can do steps 2 and 3 while you wait. Step 4 works once you are accepted.
It is an alpha, so things break: a bug found by four people is a bug that gets
fixed by the weekend, so say when you find one.

## 1. Come into the Discord

**Thornswood is eighteen and over.** Joining is you stating that you are. The
[rules](/rules) say what that is about before they say anything else.

**Thornswood is open.** Anyone can download it and anyone in the Discord can
play. Read the [rules](/rules), because being in the Discord and in the world
means accepting them.

Your Discord account is what lets you in. There is nothing else to sign up
for, no second password, and no form on this site.
<!-- /open -->

## 2. Take the installer

One file, from the [Downloads](/downloads) page. Download it and run it.

It is small because the mods are not in it. It fetches Thornswood's own content
while you watch, about half a gigabyte, and a connection that drops carries on
where it stopped rather than starting again. It puts in the launcher, the
script extender and Thornswood's own content, and nothing else.

## 3. Install the collection in Vortex

Not optional. Without it you have a launcher and no mods, and the server turns
you away when you press Play.

The link is on the [Downloads](/downloads) page and on the launcher's
Diagnostics page. Open it and Vortex takes it from there: it makes a profile for Thornswood,
downloads every mod from its own author, and deploys them. Give it time.

If the wrong profile is active in Vortex, the launcher says so before you press
Play.

## 4. Connect your Discord in the launcher

Open Thornswood from the desktop shortcut and press **Connect Discord** on the
main page. Your browser opens, you say yes, and it closes itself.

You never do this again.

## 5. Press Play

Not Skyrim. Not Steam. Not SKSE. Always the Thornswood shortcut.

The launcher checks for updates and takes any that are waiting, because
everybody has to be running the same files or nobody can connect. It also
compares every plugin with the server's copy, byte for byte. If one differs it
says so, and **Fix** downloads the server's copy of that plugin.

Then the game loads to its main menu and asks who you are today: one of your
characters, or a new one. Pick and press Play.

A new character arrives in a quiet hall and the race menu opens, and that is
where you make your face. When you are done, a panel opens on its own for the
three choices on the [Professions](/classes) page: your class, your
profession and the half of it you will make your own, and the town you wake
up in. Only the town has to be chosen before you leave the hall, and choosing
it sends you to your inn; your class and profession can wait, and are picked
later in the world from the same panel. Until you pick a profession you cannot
make anything at a bench, smelting and tanning included, so do not wait long if
you mean to make things. You arrive in the clothes you stand in,
with forty gold. The same panel is behind **K** from then on, for your skill
points.

There is no address to type and no password to remember.

## Voice

Voice runs in the launcher, not the game, so leave the launcher open while you
play. Push to talk. Whisper and yell change how far your voice carries in the
world.

## If it goes wrong

Check the [known issues](/known) first. A lot of what looks like a bug is a
limit of how a shared Skyrim works, and it is written down with the reason. The
[help](/help) page has the usual fixes.

If it is not there, say so in the Discord with what you were doing, what you
expected, and what happened instead, or use the [report](/report) page.

The launcher's own log is at `C:\Thornswood\Profile\launcher.log`. Crash logs,
if the game closed itself, are in `C:\Thornswood\Profile\MyGames\SKSE`,
because Thornswood keeps its own My Games folder. In the launcher,
**Diagnostics** then **Build the report** puts them in one zip and opens the
folder it is in: drag that zip into your ticket in the Discord.
