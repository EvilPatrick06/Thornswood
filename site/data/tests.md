# Test These

Work down in order. Mark PASS, FAIL or SKIP under each one, put what happened in the box, and your name beside it.

If it fails, write what you saw in plain words. Do not work out why. Drop any file the test names into the Drive folder.

Logs, all wiped at every game start so copy them before launching again:

```
C:\Thornswood\Game\Data\Platform\thornswood-front.log
C:\Thornswood\Game\Data\Platform\thornswood-voice.log
C:\Thornswood\Game\Data\Platform\thornswood-loadorder.txt
C:\Thornswood\Profile\launcher.log
```

## STOP. If the game says LOAD ORDER ERROR

Do not carry on and do not file anything from that session. Your mods are out
of step with the server, so the objects on your machine are not the objects on
everybody else's, and every fault you see after that is a guess.

1. Quit the game.
2. In the launcher press **Scan**. It names the plugin and the position.
3. Press **Fix**. It puts the server's order into this build's plugin list.
   Nothing is downloaded and nothing in Vortex changes.
4. Press Play again. If the error is gone, carry on from TEST 1.

If Scan says everything checks out and the game still shows the error, that is
worth reporting on its own. Send `thornswood-loadorder.txt` from the list at
the top of this page with the report, and say which build you are on. It is at
the bottom of the launcher, under Settings.

A report filed from a session showing that message costs an evening to chase
and cannot be trusted. On 17 September a mining fault was reported from one,
and the mining was never the problem.

## Before you start: send us your load order once

This is a one-off and it takes a minute. After you have started the game at
least once, find this file and paste it into the Discord with your name:

```
C:\Thornswood\Game\Data\Platform\thornswood-loadorder.txt
```

It is the list of mods the game actually loaded, in the order it loaded them,
and it is the only way to know whether your machine is carrying anything the
server is not. On one machine in September it held 62 plugins where the server
had 60, because Skyrim loads Creation Club content it finds in Data whether or
not any list asks for it. That machine got LOAD ORDER ERROR and the launcher
still said everything checked out.

The launcher catches that case now. What nobody has checked is whether anybody
else is carrying the same two extra files, and Steam has been putting them in
every Special Edition install since the 1.6 updates. Your file settles it.

## TEST 1. Launcher opens and closes

1. Open the launcher.
2. Close it with the X.
3. Open it again.
4. If it does not open, press Ctrl Shift Escape and look for Thornswood in the list.

Pass if it opens the second time. If not, note whether Thornswood was still in Task Manager.

## TEST 2. Log in with no red error

1. Press Play.
2. Watch the whole way through loading. Do not skip.
3. Reach your character.

Pass if there is no red text at any point. If there is, press tilde for the console, scroll up, and screenshot every line naming a mod that does not match. All of them, not just the first.

Grab `thornswood-loadorder.txt` either way.

## TEST 3. People in the world

1. Go to Whiterun and walk through the market.
2. Leave through the main gate.
3. Walk the road for two minutes.

Pass if you see townsfolk, wildlife, bandits or animals. Named quest characters and guards are deliberately absent, so do not count those.

## TEST 4. Armour stays on

1. Put on a full set of armour, every slot.
2. Equip a different chest piece.
3. Equip a helmet.
4. Equip a shield.
5. Equip a cloak if you have one.
6. Open your inventory and check everything is still worn.
7. Quit all the way out to the desktop. Not to the main menu, all the way out.
8. Start the launcher again, play, and load the same character.
9. Before you touch anything, look at what you are wearing.
10. Open your inventory and count what is in it.

Pass if each piece went on, nothing came off by itself, and you came back wearing
exactly what you logged out in.

Steps 7 to 10 are the ones that matter and this test went months without them. On
20 September somebody rejoined, watched a stream of items appear in the corner as
if they were being handed over, opened the pack and found it empty, and was
standing there with no clothes on. Every step above 6 passed that day. A test that
never logs out cannot see any of it, because the whole failure happens in the first
second and a half after a character loads.

If it fails, say which of the two it was: nothing worn, or nothing in the pack at
all. Both are worth knowing separately.

Grab `thornswood-front.log`.

## TEST 5. Spells stay equipped

1. Read a spell tome your character can learn: a Mage with a spell point, and a
   Novice spell of one of their two schools. Prefer Odin, Apocalypse or
   Triumvirate over vanilla. A tome you cannot learn stays in your pack and chat
   says which of the three you are missing (a spell point, the rank, a spell of
   the rank below); that is the rule working, not a failure.
2. Equip the spell.
3. Cast it.
4. Wait ten seconds and check it is still in your hand.
5. Quit out to the desktop, come back in, and check it is still learned.

Step 5 for the same reason as TEST 4: a spell the server did not itself grant used
to be taken straight back off your hand, and the only way to see it is to leave and
return.

If it fails, name the spell and the mod.

## TEST 6. Locks

1. Travel somewhere you have never been. A bandit camp or dungeon.
2. Find a chest or door that should be locked.
3. Try to open it, then pick it.

Pass if it was locked and lockpicking worked. Anywhere visited before this week may be permanently unlocked, so only a new location tests this.

## TEST 7. Enemy health and damage

1. Find a bandit or wolf on your own.
2. Hit it once and watch the health bar.
3. Keep going until it dies.
4. Note if the bar ever jumped back up.
5. Note if the bar moved when your own health moved.
6. Then get someone else to fight the same enemy with you.
7. Check you both see it take damage and both see it die.

## TEST 8. Enchanted weapons

1. Equip an enchanted weapon, any element.
2. Hit an enemy.
3. Watch for the effect and the extra damage.

## TEST 9. Keyboard on load in

1. Load into the world.
2. Straight away try to walk forward.
3. Open your inventory.
4. Open the map.

If the keyboard is dead, in this order: press Escape once and try to move, and write down whether that fixed it. If not, alt tab out and back, and write down whether that did. Escape is the fix that shipped, so which one worked is the answer.

Grab `thornswood-front.log`.

## TEST 10. No bounty for anything

1. Open the Journal, General Stats, and look at the bounty for each hold.
2. In a town, take something a trader owns while they watch (the prompt says Steal).
3. Strike a trader once.
4. Open the Journal again.

Pass if every hold's bounty is still 0. There are no NPC guards, so nobody comes for you either way.

## TEST 11. Voice

Needs two people.

1. Get in world with someone standing near you.
2. Look at the microphone icon at the bottom of the screen.
3. Hold V. The icon should turn green while held.
4. Talk. Ask if they heard you.
5. Let go of V. Talk again. Ask if they can STILL hear you.
6. Press B. The word should change between WHISPER, LOCAL and YELL.
7. Set whisper and walk away until they stop hearing you.
8. Set yell and do the same. Yell should carry much further.

Step 5 matters most. If they hear you with the key released, say so straight away.

Grab `thornswood-voice.log` and `launcher.log`.

## TEST 12. Restart warning

1. Ask Patrick to send a test restart while you are playing.
2. Watch the chat.

Pass if a message says what is happening and how long, then more as it counts down.

## TEST 13. Field of view

1. In the launcher open Display. The Field of view box should read 65.
2. Press Apply without changing it. Start the game. Nothing should look different.
3. Quit. Set it to 90. Press Apply. Start the game.

Pass if at 90 the view is noticeably wider.

## TEST 14. Chains and cage doors

Press E on a pull chain, a lever, and a cage gate.

## TEST 15. Dwemer bars

In any Dwemer ruin, press E on the control for the sliding bars over a doorway.

## TEST 16. Compass

Look at the compass near an undiscovered location. It should show a blacked out marker rather than nothing.

## TEST 17. New character

Make a fresh character and wait two minutes after logging in. It used to freeze a few seconds in and need Task Manager.

## TEST 18. The start screen, the sealed scroll and the character slots

Five parts. Do them in order on one launch, on the dev build. Copy
`thornswood-front.log` from the list at the top of this page afterwards, whatever happened.

1. Press Play and wait for the start screen. The sealed scroll is resting on the
   ledge by the warrior, and there is a soft gold glow around it that brightens
   and dims. Pass if the glow is there and you can tell the scroll is something
   to click.
2. Leave the game where it is, click on another program, and type a few keys
   into it: Enter, Space, Escape, the arrow keys, a number. Come back and look.
   Pass if the scroll is still sealed and you are still on the start screen.
   Fail if the seal broke, if the slots came up, or if the game went into the
   world as one of your characters.
3. Click the scroll. It breaks the seal and unrolls. Now click Continue. Pass if
   the slots come up and the mouse was the only thing you used.
4. Sit on the slots and do nothing for ten minutes. Pass if you are still
   looking at the slots. Fail if the game loads the world as your last
   character on its own. Then click a character and play as normal.
5. Start again, and this time tick **Start without the scroll next time** on the
   open scroll before you press Continue. A small box saying **Show the sealed
   scroll next time** appears over Close the game. Leave it unticked, close the
   game, and press Play again. Pass if the scroll is gone and the slots come up
   at once. Now tick that box, close the game, press Play again, and pass if the
   scroll is back.

On part 5 with the scroll switched off, the slots do go in as your last
character after three minutes. That is deliberate and not a fault: the wait
without end is for people who are still being shown the scroll.

## Do not report these

Typing in another window still moves your character. A flute, lute or drum looks wrong when you equip it and plays nothing. They come from PlayFluteLuteDrum.esp, which handles equipping one and playing it with scripts that never fire here. Use the Lute, Flute and Drum emotes instead: open the emote wheel with G, or whatever key the launcher's Controls page gives it if you have moved it, then search for Lute, Flute or Drum. Mod settings menus reset every session only in QuickLoot, the instrument menu, MCM Recorder and SkyUI's favourite group and unequip options; Apocalypse, moreHUD, Atlas Map Markers, Skyrim Unbound and chfshVariousActions now keep theirs, so report one of those if it forgets. NPCs keep moving when nobody is near them now, and what comes next for them is on the roadmap, so report an NPC only if it stands still or does something the Known Issues page does not already describe. You cannot save.
