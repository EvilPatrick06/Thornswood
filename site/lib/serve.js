  One malformed request used to take the whole site down, and the game's login
  with it.

  The handler is async, so anything it throws becomes a rejected promise rather
  than an exception, and an unhandled rejection ends the process. A request for
  /% is enough on its own: decodeURIComponent throws URIError on a percent sign
  that is not followed by two hex digits, and that is the third line of the
  handler, before any route has been looked at. Nobody has to be attacking
  anything. A scanner walking the address space does it without meaning to.

  Deploy-Docs.ps1 restarts the process three times an hour and then gives up,
  so a few seconds of a bored scanner took the site off the internet until
  somebody noticed, and with it /api/play/allowed, which is what the launcher
  asks before it will let anybody connect. The site being down meant nobody
  could start the game.

  So the handler is a named function now and nothing calls it without a catch.
  A bad URL is the request's fault and gets 400; anything else is ours and gets
  500, logged with a stack so it can be fixed rather than quietly swallowed.

  /*
    Bans and notes from staff in the game (#412): /ban, /unban and /note in
    the gamemode's staff block. Keyed with the door's key in the header, like
    /api/report/game above, and /dev on the front from the dev server.

    The game server has already checked that the one asking holds a staff
    role and proved who they are (join token and join pass). This checks the
    role again here, on the Discord account that holds their profile, so a
    game server cannot make somebody staff by saying so.

    One character or the whole account (#1010): ban and unban are the one
    character, kept under "p:<profile>"; banaccount and unbanaccount are the
    Discord account holding the profile, so every character on it is covered,
    and a new one too, and the door leaves them all out. A profile no account
    holds has no account to ban, and says so. minutes 0 is for good. pk kills
    the character for good (see PK): it is kept, never played again. Staff
    may do any of these to staff; the game refuses only doing it to yourself.
    unpk (/unpk) undoes a PK made by mistake, for the admin role only (see
    PK); the character is found by findDead, and o.why is required.

      A number already against somebody else's Discord account is theirs, and
      this used to write it against the caller's account anyway.

      Found reading the code for To Do List entry 142, identity on the game
      server being a number the client picks. voice-server.js sends every
      profile id to every voice peer five times a second, so any account with
      the play role could learn somebody's id, check in with it here, and
      from then on /api/play/owns below answered "theirs" and the voice
      service minted a proven token for it. /owns already refuses somebody
      else's number; this is the same loop, run before anything is written.

      The caller's own list is read first, the way /owns reads it, so a
      person checking in again with an id they already hold is always
      claimed, even if an older file also has that id against a second
      account. An id nobody holds still belongs to whoever checks in with it
      first, which is the launcher that just made the character.

      Not written, and NOT refused. The first cut of this answered 409, and
      that locked out a tester who had done nothing wrong. The launcher's
      character list is kept per install, not per Discord account, and the
      door check (Door.Check, before Chars.Prepare) sends the id played last.
      So an install that had played under one account and was then linked to
      another with the launcher's own Unlink and Connect Discord (a second
      person on a shared PC, an alt, somebody who changed accounts) got a 409
      on every Play, a warning box, and no game, with no way to reach New
      character at the menu. Refusing protected nothing either: the yes below
      carries no password, and nothing in it is about the character, only
      about the account that asked. What needed protecting is linked.json,
      and leaving the id off the caller's list is the whole of that. The
      caller is still stamped as seen, because they did check in. claimed
      false says the id was left off, for whoever wants to read it.

      Such an install's spare, the id the menu's New character uses, was
      checked in under the first account too, and this route cannot tell it
      from an id somebody took. So the launcher mints the relinked account a
      fresh spare before it checks anything in (Chars.EnsureSpare), and the
      new character is filed under the account that made it.

      WHAT THIS COSTS SOMEBODY WHO CHANGED ACCOUNTS, which is new with this
      rule and not something main did. Measured by a reviewer on 24 September
      running this route, /owns and /api/allowed from main and from here: an
      install with characters 700 and 701 made under A, relinked to B. On main
      B took both at its first Play. Here they stay A's. While A is in the
      Discord the game's door still lets them in on A's standing, but /owns
      calls them somebody else's, so the voice service refuses B a token on
      either. Whether that is the right price for stopping id theft is
      Patrick's to decide; an admin action that moves an id between accounts
      is the other half of it and is not built.
      What is not a price worth paying is the rest of what the reviewer
      found: once A left the Discord, /api/allowed dropped 700 and 701 and
      the door turned B away from both, with a hand edit of linked.json on the
      VPS the only way back. So an id held only by accounts that have left the
      Discord, and are not banned (hasLeft), is free: it is taken off them and
      claimed by whoever checks in with it, which for that install is B at its
      next Play.

      kept in the order ids first arrived and cut to its last eight, and an id
      already on it never moved. Every Play checks the characters in before
      the spare, and a relinked install mints a new spare each time it goes
      back to an account, so that account's list grew by one spare per switch
      while its characters sat at the front. On the ninth id its oldest
      character fell off, and the other account's next Play checked it in
      with nobody holding it and claimed it for good, which is the same harm
      the holder rule below exists to stop. Measured with test-play-join.js:
      one character, A to B to A each round, off A's list after round seven
