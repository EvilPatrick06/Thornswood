/* ---- release copies (#3686) ----
   DOWNLOADS COME FROM THIS REPOSITORY'S RELEASES (Patrick, 26 Oct, for going
   public). Every launcher of every age asks this site for its files, at
   /feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>, and that never changes: a launcher from 1.2.6
   on builds each address from the feed's own folder (feedSplit, and Sync.cs
   AssetFolder for a record's files), and older ones were given these
   addresses in their feeds. What moves is where the bytes come from.
   release-files.yml puts every file a release names on a GitHub Release, on
   the release's own tag (release/main/<id>, release/dev/<id>), each named by
   its sha256. Here, once GitHub says publicly that the Release of the feed's
   current release holds a file, under that name, with that sha256 as its own
   digest and with this site's size, the asset route answers 302 to the
   Release's copy instead of sending the bytes. Every launcher since before
   25 Sep follows a redirect and allows github.com and its download hosts
   (Updater.cs AllowedHosts), and still checks the sha256 of what it gets.

   Only what GitHub answers without a token counts, so while the repository
   is private, or the Release is still a draft being filled, the answer is
   404 and the site sends the bytes itself, as it always has; the site's copy
   is also what any release the Release does not hold is served from. A
   Release once seen is kept: release-files.yml publishes it only after every
   file is on it, and never replaces a file of a published one. One that is
   not there yet is asked about again RELEASE_LOOK_MS later, never sooner,
   which keeps the site inside GitHub's sixty unsigned calls an hour. The
   lookup never holds a download: the request that starts it is served from
   here. site/tests/test-release-copies.js drives this block, and the setup
   programs below it. */

   that number at Play (Updater.Version), and a channel lets it in when its
