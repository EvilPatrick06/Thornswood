  The site and Caddy start at normal priority: normal for the processor, the
  disk and memory, the same as a service on the box. Voice starts at high
  priority for the processor, with the game servers, and normal for the disk
  and memory.

  WHY VOICE IS HIGH (#2491). Decided by Patrick on 12 Oct 2026 at about
  6:20 PM: "we need to fix it so the servers run on high priority". Voice
  runs with the game servers, above the six build runners, the site, Caddy
  and the bot. Its task is registered at priority 1, HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS, and
  node is started through cmd's start /high, because cmd.exe at High starts
  node Normal unless asked (measured 12 Oct; tests\test-server-task-priority.ps1).

  WHY NOT BELOW NORMAL. Deploy-Docs.ps1, Install-Voice.ps1 and Setup-Domain.ps1 registered
  their scheduled tasks with no -Priority, so Task Scheduler used its default
  of 7: BelowNormal, I/O priority 1 (low) and memory priority 2, measured on
  the VPS on 5 October for Caddy and the site. In the kernel trace of
  4 October 17:18 Caddy's reads took a median of 47 ms, held back the same
  way the game server's were (#1931, tests\test-server-task-priority.ps1).
  Issue #1968.

  HOW. The same two parts as test-server-task-priority.ps1, for each of the
  three:
    1. Read, not run, wherever PowerShell runs. Each installer builds its
       task on the VPS in a script it sends there, a here-string in the
       installer. That here-string is found, read as the script the box
       runs, its one New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet found and the -Priority it
       passes read (none is 7, the default). For the site and Caddy it must
       be 4 to 6, the band Microsoft's table starts as NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS;
       for voice 1, HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS, never 0, realtime, and voice's task
       command line must start node through start "" /b /wait /high.
    2. On Windows, that call is run for real (it only builds the settings),
       and a task with those settings and a made-up name is registered: for
       SYSTEM as a service when this shell is elevated, which is what all
       three run as on the box (the site may be LOCAL SERVICE, which the
       priority does not depend on), and otherwise for the person running
       this, logged on interactively. For the site and Caddy its action is
       cmd.exe /c starting a program: their tasks start their program
       directly, so what counts is the process the task starts (cmd.exe
       here). For voice it is voice's own command line, with Windows
       PowerShell sleeping in place of node and a scratch log and roller:
       its task starts cmd.exe, which starts node through start /high, so
       what counts is cmd's child. Both processes are measured for each:
       Normal, I/O priority 2 and memory priority 5 for the site and Caddy,
       High, 2 and 5 for voice. The task and its processes are removed again
       whatever happens. Where a task cannot be registered or does not start
       for this account (a build runner's service account), this part says
       SKIP and why.

  -DeployDocs, -InstallVoice and -SetupDomain read another copy of each, so
  the same test runs on the ones from before this change:

      git show origin/main:scripts/deploy/Setup-Domain.ps1 > $env:TEMP\domain-before.ps1
      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-service-task-priority.ps1 -SetupDomain $env:TEMP\domain-before.ps1

  Registers and removes one task at a time named Thornswood priority harness
  <guid> (not 'Thornswood Test...', which test-deploy-swaps and
  test-install-server clear away, #1135), stops the cmd.exe and Windows
  PowerShell it started, and removes the scratch folder in TEMP that holds
  voice's log and roller; writes nothing else.
