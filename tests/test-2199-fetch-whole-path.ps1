  Issue #2199, the refresh of the scheduled fetch. On 12 Oct
  Fetch-Backups.ps1 -Schedule was run through Git Bash with an unquoted
  -To C:\Users\you\Downloads\Thornswood-Repo\local\backups. Bash dropped
  the backslashes, the script got C:UsersevilpDownloadsThornswood-Repolocalbackups,
  a path relative to the current folder on drive C:, made that folder where
  it ran, and registered the task with it word for word. The task's next run
  would have fetched into a new folder under its own copy's folder.

  This runs the real script with paths that are not whole and reads what
  happens:

    - a drive-relative -To (C:name), a folder-relative -To and a -To that
      starts at the root of the drive are each refused, exit 1, naming the
      path, with no folder made where the script ran and nothing written to
      a fetch.log there
    - with -Schedule, a bad -To or -KeyFile is refused before the scripts are
      copied or a task is registered (a task name of its own, checked after)
    - a whole -To (C:\...) still works, with -PruneOnly

  The script runs under Windows PowerShell 5.1, which the task uses. Touches
  nothing but a scratch folder under the temp folder; LOCALAPPDATA is pointed
  into it for the runs, so even a broken refusal would not copy over the
  real scheduled copy.
