// Issue #1397: the population cut (catalogue, habitat limits, difficulty
// tiers) is in release 1.2.3 on dev and main, but docs/systems/npcs.md and
// docs/NPC-POPULATION.md still said it was waiting for a future dev release.
// This keeps both pages, and the generator that writes NPC-POPULATION.md,
// from going back to calling the live cut unreleased.
