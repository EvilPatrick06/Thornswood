  What a stranger reads on the site's News page.

  Entry 187 on the To Do List, "The public news feed is a developer
  changelog": "Patch notes people read are short and about what they will
  notice: lockpicking works, locks are back. The front page currently shows
  strangers a 403 and a load order index".

  MEASURED 24 SEPTEMBER. The newest entry in this repo's version.json was one
  Publish-Server wrote on 20 September. Its body was "The server at" the VPS
  address "was reinstalled and is answering", and two of its three details
  were "The gamemode was rebuilt: starting kits, creation and arrival points
  live in it" and "Load order: 60 plugins server side". They reached the site.

  The site writes its News page itself since #5187 (site/server.js, "news
  from the Release"); tests\test-5187-site-news.js drives its cleaning over
  feeds in those shapes. This reads Publish-Server.ps1 and checks those lines
  are no longer written at all, and that Publish-Discord strips every kind of
  line the site's page strips, because its comment says they are the same
  list.

  -Repo runs it against another copy of the scripts.

  Read only.
