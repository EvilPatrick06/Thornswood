      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-go-retired-overlays.ps1

  Go.ps1 takes out of Data\Platform\UI every overlay of ours the repo no
  longer has, lists it as removed so its kept copy goes and the release
  deletes it from every install, and leaves everything else in that folder
  alone.

  WHY. The #3130 loading screen test put thornswood-loadscreen.js on dev on
  22 Oct. Its branch was pulled the same day, and the dev Ship from main that
  was to take it off said "0 removed": Go.ps1's overlays loop copies each of
  game\ui's scripts into the game folder Ship packs from and never took one
  out, and Ship-Rules counts any thornswood-* file there as ours, so the dead
  file would have stayed on every install for good. Measured on Nyx the same
  evening: D:\Thornswood-DevBuild\Game\Data\Platform\UI\thornswood-loadscreen.js
  was still there.

  HOW. Remove-RetiredOverlays is lifted out of Go.ps1 with PowerShell's own
  parser and run against a game folder made under a temp folder, with a
  stand-in game\ui. Go.ps1 is read, not run.
