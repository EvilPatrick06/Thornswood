  Issue #2513. A harness ran on a pull request only if its author also typed
  its name into .github\workflows\build.yml, and nothing checked that they
  did. test-release-baseline.ps1 and test-publish-refusals.ps1 went red on
  main and the build stayed green, because neither was named there.

  Since #3009 there is no name to forget: the gate runs every tests\test-*.js
  and tests\test-*.ps1 that tests\gate-excluded.txt does not name, as
  scripts\dev\Gate-Harnesses.ps1 lists them (tests\test-gate-list.ps1 checks
  that script and the gate step). What is left to hold is the excluded list
  against what build.yml runs in steps of their own. This fails on:
    1. a harness build.yml runs in a step of its own (by path, or by name in
       quotes) that gate-excluded.txt does not name, since the gate would run
       it a second time;
    2. an excluded line that says "own step in build.yml" for a harness
       build.yml does not run, since that harness then runs nowhere on a pull
       request;
    3. build.yml or build-pr.yml no longer running the gate through
       Gate-Harnesses.ps1, or excluding test-release-baseline.ps1,
       test-publish-refusals.ps1 or this harness.
  The same reader is then run over a planted repository with one of each,
  so a reader that finds nothing anywhere cannot pass by accident.

  Read only, apart from the planted folder under TEMP, which it removes.
