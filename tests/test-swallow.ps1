<#
  test-swallow.ps1

  The silent catches in the launcher, entry 239 on the To Do List, and the
  rule that stops their number growing.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured 24 Sep: 386 of the 618 catch clauses in
  launcher\app\*.cs had nothing between their braces. A failure in any of them
  leaves no line in launcher.log, so a tester says the Save button did nothing
  and there is nothing to read. The entry counted 367, then 373, then 386
  while it waited, so the count is held by Check-Swallow.ps1 against
  swallow-baseline.txt rather than by anybody remembering.

  What this drives, all of it the real code:

    1. Check-Swallow.ps1 against the real launcher\app and the checked in
       baseline, which has to pass.
    2. Check-Swallow.ps1 against a copy in a temp folder, with one empty catch
       planted in each shape the rule counts. Each one has to go red and name
       the file, and taking it out again has to go green.
    3. The shapes the rule does not count: a body holding only a comment, and
       a body that logs. And a count that falls, which since #756 is red the
       same as a rise until the baseline line is lowered to what the file
       holds, because a fall that passed with a yellow hint was left for
       whoever came next.
    3c. The site, voice and the bot (#2736): every shape the rule counts in
       JavaScript and in Python goes red, the shapes it does not stay green,
       what is never read (node_modules, a .min.js, a harness beside the
       code, a venv) stays green with an empty catch in it, and one more
       empty catch in a copy of the real site\server.js or bot\bot.py goes
       red against the real baseline's own line for it.
    4. Swallow.Note, compiled from the real Swallow.cs with a stand-in for
       Paths, with the compiler the build runs (Add-LauncherType,
       tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1, #2821; off Windows that part says SKIP), and
       called. It has to write the line, and it has to not throw
       with no log set, with the log's folder missing, or with the log held
       open by something else, because a helper that throws from inside a
       catch is worse than the empty catch it replaced.
    5. The places the entry named (Config.Save, Swap.Restore and its
       DropLink, Hold.Release, Keep.Unpark), lifted out of the real files by
       brace match: no silent catch left, every catch logs under its own
       name, and none of them throws, because the change was to what they
       log and not to what they do.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
