Issue #2353: closing a ticket archived and locked its Discord thread and
nothing ever deleted it, so it was the one store with no keeping time.
Decided by Patrick on 19 Oct: the bot deletes a ticket thread
TICKET_KEEP_DAYS (365) after it closes, checked every hour like the join
numbers.

ticket_past_keeping and age_closed_tickets are lifted out of bot/bot.py by
their source and run on their own against made-up servers, channels and
threads, so this needs neither discord.py nor a token and runs on every pull
request. It proves:
  - a ticket the bot opened and that closed 366 days ago is deleted, with a
    line in the log, and one that closed 364 days ago stays;
  - a thread still open, one a Gamemaster opened by hand, and one in a
    channel that is not a ticket channel are never touched;
  - a thread whose close time cannot be read is kept, not guessed at;
  - Discord is asked for the private closed threads closed before the cut;
  - a delete Discord refuses is said with its reason, and the rest still go;
  - a channel whose list cannot be read is said with its reason, and the
    next channel is still aged;
and that the bot starts the hourly watch when it is ready, the close message
and the privacy page say the year, and the bot is still allowed to delete
threads. Synthetic ids only. Read only.
