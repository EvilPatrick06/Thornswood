      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-virustotal-upload.ps1

  Publish-VirusTotal.ps1 sends a published file to VirusTotal, and nothing it
  can run into stops a release.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The Downloads page has printed the installer's SHA-256 with
  a link to VirusTotal's report on that hash since 24 September, and nothing
  ever sent the file, so every one of those links landed on VirusTotal's
  "item not found" page. The upload is the missing half, and the half that
  matters here is the failure: it runs at the end of Publish-Installer, after
  a gigabyte has already gone to the VPS and the site is already serving it,
  so an upload that threw would report a failed publish for a publish that
  worked.

  So this runs the real script, in a child PowerShell, and reads what it did:

    no VT_API_KEY                    exit 0, "skipped (VT_API_KEY not set)"
    a VT_API_KEY of spaces           the same, because empty is not set
    a key and no file                exit 0, naming the path
    a key and nothing answering      exit 0, naming the report address
    a key and VirusTotal has it      exit 0, "already has this build"
    a key VirusTotal refuses (401)   exit 0, saying the key was refused
    a file it has not seen           sent, and what arrived is read
    a file over 32 MB                sent to the upload address it hands out
    a file over 650 MB               refused by the cap, nothing sent

  and that the key never appears in anything printed, on any of those paths.

  WHY IT IS SAFE TO RUN ANYWHERE. It never reaches VirusTotal. Every case
  points the script at -Api on 127.0.0.1, either at a port where nothing is
  listening or at a stand-in that answers the calls VirusTotal's API v3
  answers and writes down what it was sent. The key in every case is a made
  up string, and the files are made in a temp folder this removes. The two
  large files are sparse: they are the length the case needs and take no disk.

  It also reads Publish-Installer.ps1 for the call, because a helper nothing
  calls publishes nothing.

#
# VirusTotal's API v3, as much of it as this script calls, on the loopback
# address in a background job. It answers GET /files/<hash> the way the case
# asks, hands out an upload address, takes a POST, and writes one line per
# request into a log the checks below read. It never writes the key it was
# sent, only whether the header was there and matched.
#
# A socket and HTTP written out by hand, rather than HttpListener, which is
# the obvious way and cannot be used here: on Windows it needs the URL
# reserved with netsh or the process elevated, and the nightly runner on the
# VPS is a plain local account that is neither. This needs nothing but a port
# on 127.0.0.1, which every machine gives anybody.
#
# It ends itself on a request to /stop rather than being killed. Measured
# while writing this: Stop-Job on a job sitting in an accept call does not
# always come back, and the harness hung there for as long as it was given.
# /ping is how the case below knows it is up, and neither of those two is
# counted or written down.
