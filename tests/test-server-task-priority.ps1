      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-server-task-priority.ps1

  The game server's scheduled task starts it at high priority for the
  processor, and normal for the disk and memory.

  WHY HIGH (#2491). Decided by Patrick on 12 Oct 2026 at about 6:20 PM: "we
  need to fix it so the servers run on high priority". The VPS has six cores,
  and its six build runners are services at Normal, so a build took the
  processor from both game servers at the same priority as them. The task is
  registered at priority 1, HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS, and node is started through
  cmd's start /high: a task at 1 starts its cmd.exe High, and cmd.exe starts
  node Normal unless asked (measured 12 Oct, cmd High and its child Normal),
  because Windows hands a parent's class on only for Idle and BelowNormal.

  WHY NOT BELOW NORMAL. The first-move stall: the server stopped for seconds, on 5 October for
  48 s, when somebody first entered a cell. The kernel trace of 4 October
  17:19 (logs\dev\stall-trace-20261004-173319) has the dev server's main
  thread reading its own memory back from pagefile.sys at low I/O priority,
  24 ms a read on average where normal priority reads on the same disk took a
  median of 0.1 to 0.5 ms: 91 such reads made a login take 1.9 s, 51 the 2.1 s
  after a move into WhiterunWorld. The low priority came from the task.
  Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 registered it without -Priority, Task
  Scheduler's default is 7, and on the VPS on 5 October both game servers ran
  BelowNormal with I/O priority 1 and memory priority 2, under the build
  runners, the bot and lsass at Normal, 2 and 5.

  HOW.
    1. Read, not run, wherever PowerShell runs: the installer is parsed, its
       one New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet found and the -Priority it passes read
       (none is 7, the default every Thornswood task on the VPS showed on
       5 October). It must be 1, HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS in Microsoft's table,
       never 0, which is realtime. Its one task command line, $cmd, must
       start node through start "" /b /wait /high, running server-log.js,
       which runs the server and writes its log (#2349).
    2. On Windows, that same call is run for real (it only builds the
       settings; nothing is registered by it), and a task with those settings
       and a made-up name is registered. Its principal is the installer's
       own call run for real (SYSTEM, as a service) when this shell is
       elevated, and otherwise the person running this, logged on
       interactively, so no admin and no password. Its action is the
       installer's own command line, with node and the real Server-Log.js,
       and a stand-in server that sleeps in place of skymp5-server.js, in a
       scratch folder, so what is measured is what start /high starts under
       cmd.exe and what that starts, as on the VPS. It is started, and both
       processes are asked what Windows gave them: priority class
       (GetPriorityClass), I/O priority (NtQueryInformationProcess,
       ProcessIoPriority) and memory priority (GetProcessInformation,
       ProcessMemoryPriority). They must be High, 2 and 5: high for the
       processor, and no lower on the disk or memory than a service on the
       box. Windows starts a child of a High process at Normal, so the
       server is High only because server-log.js gives it its own class. The task and its processes are removed again whatever happens,
       and the test checks they are gone. Where a task cannot be registered
       or does not start for this account (a build runner's service account
       has no session to start it in), this part says SKIP and why.

  -Installer reads another copy of the installer, so the same test runs on the
  one from before this change:

      git show 2c872310:scripts/deploy/Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 > $env:TEMP\install-before.ps1
      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-server-task-priority.ps1 -Installer $env:TEMP\install-before.ps1

  Registers and removes one task named Thornswood priority harness <guid> (for
  SYSTEM when elevated, else for the account running it), stops the cmd.exe
  and the node processes it started, and removes the scratch folder in TEMP
  that holds its log and the stand-in server; writes nothing else.
