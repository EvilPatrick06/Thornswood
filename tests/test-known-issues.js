// test-known-issues.js
//
// The Known Issues page stops calling roadmap work permanent, and every other
// place that describes the same rows says the same thing about them.
//
// From the To Do List, entry 296: "Pick one and say it once. If NPC behaviour
// is being worked on, it belongs under a heading that says so rather than one
// that tells people never to report it. The tester note repeats the permanent
// version, so three places currently disagree about whether this is a limit
// or a task".
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED ON 24 SEPTEMBER. known.md opened its first table with
// "They are not going to change" over NPCs standing still and NPC behaviour
// differing, while board.json's roadmap carries Thinning the crowd and NPCs
// with their own work under Next. Patrick decided the NPC cut on 17 September
// (To Do entry 320), so the roadmap is the one that is right. It was not three
// places but six: the /known link preview in server.js and the same string in
// public/home.html both opened "Permanent limits", the hub's own copy of the
// board in board.json said "none are changing", the tester note listed NPCs
// under Do not report these, and the Help page listed them under "All of that
// is deliberate". The other three rows in that table are open To Do entries
// too (299 mod settings, 323 Papyrus events, 300 killmoves and stagger), so
// the fix is to the promise over the table rather than to two of its rows.
//
// SINCE #3140 the rows and the roadmap are both on the issue board, so what
// this checks is the part of the page the repository still writes, and that
// the other places keep saying the same.
//
// Read only.
