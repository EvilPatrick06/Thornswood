// Make a mold, stamp it on a door, cut keys off it for ever.

// Patrick, 23 September, after finding he could not get a key at all: "Wait how
// tf does someone use a mold if you can't make a key to own the building make
// this shit make sense make a fucking mold item craftable dude this would solve
// alot", and then the whole shape in one line: "The key should be too what
// should happen is you make a mold, mold gets used on door to assign mold to
// the door, than key uses that mold during crafting to make a key to
// specifically that house and it can be reused". And: "Each door in a property
// should take the same key".
//
// It was circular before this. Both records had been in the plugin since the
// property system was built and nothing in the game made either one: the only
// mold in the world was conjured out of nothing by /mold at a door, so the
// ceremony had to happen before the object existed.
//
