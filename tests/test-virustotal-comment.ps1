  Add-VirusTotalComment.ps1 keeps its contract and never stops a release.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The engines that flag the setup program are machine
  learning scores and hash intelligence rather than signatures for anything
  known. A comment on the report saying what the file is, who publishes it and
  where from is signal added beside the certificate (issue #390) while the
  signed publisher has little reputation (docs\VIRUSTOTAL-FALSE-POSITIVE.md). That makes it a
  script that runs at the end of a release, and the failure worth guarding
  against is not a missing comment: it is a missing comment that stops a
  release which has already been published. So every way out has to be exit 0.

  The other one is commenting under the wrong hash, which is worse than not
  commenting, so the file's own bytes decide the hash and a -Sha256 that
  disagrees is reported rather than used.

  WHAT IT RUNS. Four cases end before any request leaves the machine: no key,
  no file, and a hash that does not match. The fifth points the script at a
  closed port on the loopback address with a key set, which is the comment
  failing for real, and it still has to exit 0 and say why. Nothing here
  reaches VirusTotal, and the key it sets is the word that says so.

  Read only. Writes one small file into the temp folder and removes it.
