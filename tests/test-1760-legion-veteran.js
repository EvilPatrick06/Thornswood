// The public site says a person can play a Legion veteran, and that the
// embassy's six armed are its own guard, not Legion (#1760). The site's world
// page said "You can play a Legion soldier, at the embassy", and its Article
// the Third made the six armed inside the walls the one exception to the
// Legion ban, while lore/accord.md says no Legion soldier may set foot in
// Skyrim under arms, the embassy guard are not Legion, and you cannot play a
// Legion soldier. Patrick, 5 Oct: the site says a person can play a Legion
// veteran and must not say "certain events may allow it"; the lore is right
// about the embassy. Since #3138 the world page is the Accord's only copy, and
// lore/accord.md points at it, so the page is read against the ban itself.
//
// What it checks:
//   1. site/data/site/world.md says you can play a Legion veteran, and never
//      that you can play a Legion soldier;
//   2. its Article the Third says no Legion soldier sets foot in Skyrim
//      under arms, and the embassy guard are not Legion;
//   3. no public page (every site/data/site/*.md, the site's own HTML, the
//      launcher's help and the bot's channel posts) says "certain events may
//      allow", or that a person can play a Legion soldier;
//   4. docs/systems/embassy.md still says the six are not Legion and a
//      veteran can be played.
//
// Read only.
