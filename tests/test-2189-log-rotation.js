  test-2189-log-rotation.js

  #2189: when site.log could not be rolled (a rotated file held open, a
  folder that lost delete rights) the failure was swallowed and every line
  was appended anyway, so the active log grew without limit, silently.

  Runs the real makeLog from site/server.js in a scratch folder, with a
  stand-in fs whose renames can be made to fail with EBUSY, as Windows does
  when another process holds the file without share-delete:
  A. the failure is said once (console and log), naming the file and error
  B. the roll is retried after retryMs, not on every line
  C. the active file stops at the emergency ceiling (2 x maxBytes), says so
     once, and later lines go to the console only
  D. once renames work again the next write rolls, says so once, and
     ordinary logging resumes under the cap
  E. the unchanged path: rolling that works never says anything

  The retry window runs on a pretend clock (#2346). makeLog reads the time
  through Date.now(), and it is handed a Date whose now() is a number this
  file moves by hand, so "inside the window" and "after it" are steps here,
  not sleeps. With real time, A to C had to finish inside the 300 ms window:
  on the hosted runner they did not, a roll was tried during C, and C4, D3
  and D5 saw three failed tries instead of two. Slowing each append by 40 ms
  here gave the same three failures.
