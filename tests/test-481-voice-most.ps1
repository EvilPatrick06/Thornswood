  test-481-voice-most.ps1

  The voice service's number goes from records\most-online.json to the
  service's command line (issue #481, step 4).

  voice\test-most.js drives the service itself with THORNSWOOD_VOICE_MOST
  set. A setting only counts if the install hands it over, so this proves the
  path to it:

    1. MaxOnline.ps1 gives the record's voice number as Voice, 0 when the
       record has none, and refuses one under the seats (people plus staff
       seats), because somebody seated would then be kept out of voice and
       chat. The real record has one, and it is not under its own seats.
    2. RecordShape.ps1 refuses a voice that is not a whole number above zero.
    3. Install-Voice.ps1 reads the record through MaxOnline.ps1 and puts the
       number on the line that starts the service, before node, as
       THORNSWOOD_VOICE_MOST; with no number nothing is added, so the line is
       the one every install sent before. The name it sets is the name the
       service reads.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder. Never connects to
  anything.
