      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-2961-voice-port-once.ps1

  Install-Voice.ps1's "Checking from here" tries the voice port from outside
  once, says what it answered, and does not call a port shut from a machine
  that reaches no raw port on the box.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #2961: the check tried up to 15 times a second
  apart, waiting for nothing. Measured on 21 Oct 2026, the firewall rule an
  install makes is in force when New-NetFirewallRule returns, and it is made
  before the old voice is stopped, so by this point it has been in force for
  the whole swap. And from a cloud thread, whose container reaches nothing
  but HTTPS through its proxy, every raw port is silent, so a loopback
  install there printed "correctly shut" whatever the firewall did.

  HOW. Install-Voice.ps1 reaches the VPS the moment it runs, so it is parsed
  and never run. The try is Vps.ps1's Get-ThornswoodPortTry (#2975), run
  here against a listener and a closed port on this machine's loopback. The
  lines that decide what to say are lifted as text and run with that try
  stood in under Test-ThornswoodFromOutside, once for each answer the voice
  port and the game server's port can give, and what they print is held to
  what each case means.

  Never connects to anything off this machine.
