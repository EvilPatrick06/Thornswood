  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #3534. The weekly review listed the board's Order
  under "Could not read", and nothing said what a right Order is. Read on
  26 Oct 2026, 315 of the 331 open issues had none. scripts\ops\Check-Board.ps1
  holds a board.json from Read-Board.ps1 to Developer-Guide.md's board rules.

  What it checks, against boards made here:
    1. a board that keeps every rule names nothing and exits 0;
    2. an open issue with no Order, two open cards sharing one, an open card
       with no Status, a closed issue not in Done, Status options other than
       Todo, In Progress and Done, Auto-add off and Auto-close on, and an open
       issue with no card are each named under their rule, and it exits 3;
    3. an archived card and an open pull request with no Order are left out;
       an issue made after the board was read is not called missing;
    4. it stops (exit 1) on no file, a file that is not a board, and issue
       numbers that are not numbers.

  Nothing connects anywhere. Everything it writes is in its own temp folder.
