      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-2909-door-whole-write.ps1

  Issue #2909, the first of its three. Set-Door.ps1 -Enforce and -Watch read
  allowed.json, set enforce, and wrote the list back IN PLACE with
  [IO.File]::WriteAllText: the file cut to nothing, then filled. The gamemode
  reads that list whenever the door asks, and writes it whole every five
  minutes with mp.writeFileWhole, a POSIX rename (#2740). So a read beside the
  flip could find the list empty or cut short, and WriteAllText's handle,
  which does not share delete, refused the gamemode's rename while it was
  open. Now the flip writes a new file beside the list and puts it over the
  list with the same POSIX rename (Feed-Store.ps1's Move-FeedStoreInto).

  WHAT IT HOLDS IT TO.
    1. The flip writes no WriteAllText to the list itself, writes a file
       beside it, and puts it over the list with Move-FeedStoreInto, which
       it sends up with the script.
    2. In this shell and in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the box runs it with
       that), the script the flip sends, run against a list in a temp folder:
       enforce is set, every profile is kept, nothing is left beside it, and
       a reader that opened the list before the flip, sharing ReadWrite and
       Delete as the gamemode's node does, still reads the old list whole.

  -Repo runs it against another checkout's scripts (main before #2909 fails
  1 and 2). Nothing outside its own temp folder is written.
