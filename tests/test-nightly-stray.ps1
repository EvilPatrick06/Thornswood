      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-nightly-stray.ps1

  The nightly's stray check reads every page of branches and of open pull
  requests. Issue #1201: the step read branches?per_page=100 and
  pulls?state=open&per_page=100 once each, so a branch past the first hundred
  was never checked, and a branch whose open pull request was past the first
  hundred pulls was called stray when it was not.

  HOW. scripts\dev\Nightly-Stray.ps1 is dot-sourced without -Run, so it only
  defines its functions, and Invoke-RestMethod is a stand-in here that keeps
  branches and pull requests in memory and answers the way GitHub does: pages
  of 100 by per_page and page, and a JSON array handed down the pipe as ONE
  object. Then:
    1. 150 branches and 130 open pull requests. Branch 140 is on the second
       page with no pull request: it is named. Branch 120's pull request is
       on the second page of pulls: it is not named. main never is.
    2. A pull request three days old is named; one a day old is not; one
       labelled held is listed as held and not named (#1273).
    3. A run that names nothing exits 0 and one that names something exits 1,
       with the lines the step used to print.
    4. nightly.yml runs the script and the inline step is gone.
  Never connects to anything.
