// A brand new character must be seen as new, and the starting purse must not
// be what stops that happening.
//
// MEASURED ON THE LIVE SERVER, 21 September, three sessions in a row and the
// same line every time:
//
//   15:19:54  chargen ff000058 profile 744947683 already has a character
//             carrying 1 thing, in the hall, no face, so creation is skipped
//
// In the hall, no face, and told they had already done this. The thing they
// were carrying was the forty gold the starting purse had handed them seconds
// earlier, on the same tick, from a loop that ran above the one that decides
// whether somebody is new. Creation was skipped and closeRaceMenu shut the
// race menu Spawn had correctly opened, so the person was left standing in the
// creation room with nothing. Djinn described exactly that from the other side.
//
// The decision reads a pack to answer "has this person played before". Gold the
// server hands out unprompted is the one thing in a pack that is no evidence of
// that, so it does not count. The purse also moved below the whole loop. Either
// fix alone is enough; both are here because the comment the old code leaned on
// said the ordering "cannot be wrong", and it was.
//

// ------------------------------------------- dressed when made, never asked
/*
  THE SHIFT ARRIVED AND NOBODY EVER PUT IT ON (21 and 23 September). The
  engine could not write the equipment record the client dresses from, so four
  asks grew up to make the client wear it, and the one at every login put back
  on clothes somebody had taken off. Patrick, 4 October: "my clothes should
  just stay on from the moment someone creates a new character until they
  take them off".

  These checks used to hold those asks in place. Since #1560 the engine writes
  the record for an actor no client owns, and the gamemode does it once in
  created(), before the hand-over; that is run for real in
  test-dressed-at-creation.js. What this holds now is the other half: none of
  the asks is left.
