  #2827. Thornswood ships none of Data\Interface\startmenu.swf,
  Data\meshes\thornswood\noticeboard01.nif and dropbox01.nif any more: each is
  Bethesda's file edited or put together, and Bethesda's terms grant no right
  to hand those on. The launcher makes them on each machine from that
  machine's own game archives (launcher\app\FromGame*.cs, MadeFromGame.cs), and
  they must come out byte for byte the files that shipped until now. Patrick
  chose this on 19 Oct (option 2).

  WHAT THIS HOLDS.
    1. On a made-up game (tests\fixtures\2827\from-game-fixture.py writes its
       archives, every byte from fixed numbers, nothing of Bethesda's), the
       launcher's own code makes all three byte for byte what the two Python
       tools that write the recipes make: the menu Build-StartMenu.py was
       given, and the meshes Build-NoticeBoard.py builds. The made-up meshes
       carry every case the build meets, and the archives every way an
       archive stores a file (the fixture's header says which).
    2. The recipes beside the fixture are what those two tools write from it
       (their --check), when this machine's Python has numpy and lz4, which
       both read the archives with. Both tools must agree with the launcher, or a
       recipe written on One would make something else here.
    3. A game that differs makes nothing, and the reason names the file of
       the game that differs: one byte changed in a notice mesh, one in the
       menu. A game with no Skyrim - Interface.bsa names that archive.
    4. ZlibLevel6, the launcher's port of zlib's level 6, packs a run of
       awkward inputs to the same bytes as Python's zlib does.
    5. The recipes that ship come to the files that shipped: their sha256 and
       sizes are the ones on record for those files (a1dd4595..., 47cfe0f2...,
       09d8ae92...).
    6. The same files compile at C# 5, which is what Windows PowerShell 5.1's
       Add-Type compiles, because scripts\release\Go.ps1 runs them there.
    7. By the source: the three, then the collection's six menus, are
       FromGame.Files, Ship-Rules.ps1 $ShipMadeFromGame then
       $ShipMadeFromMods, and OwnGameKinds.cs MadeInGame alike; no release list
       ships them and no file at their paths is in the repository; Play, Scan
       and Fix, the own folder and Go.ps1 all make or keep them.
    8. The collection's menus with no gold values (#3113) and the journal (#3127, FromGameModMenus.cs,
       written by scripts\mods\Build-ModMenus.py from the mods' own archives,
       which no test machine has): on the made-up game, which has none of the
       mods, each of the six says which archive it needs and nothing is made;
       each names its mod and both sha256s; a recipe for a file that is not a
       SWF takes its edits on the bytes as they are; and a mod file that is not
       the pinned one names the mod.

  Reads the repository; writes only its own folder under the scratch folder.
  Needs Python (the fixture is plain Python) and the compiler the build runs.
