  Whether Check-ShipReady.ps1 says NOT READY only for what would stop a Ship.
  Issue #946.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. On 28 Sep two dev Ships from fresh worktrees ran to the end
  and published, while Check-ShipReady -Channel dev said "NOT READY. 18 passed,
  1 in the way" for each, because engine\skymp was not a clone of the skymp
  fork. A Ship never builds the engine. What it needs of the client is the
  game folder holding the recorded build, which Sync-Client.ps1 -Check
  answers, or a build that matches the record for Go.ps1 to copy in. And
  Sync-Client itself stopped on "client build not found" before looking at the
  game folder, so a worktree with no build could not Ship even when the folder
  it packs was right.

  What it runs. The row functions out of Check-ShipReady.ps1, lifted by the
  PowerShell parser (New-Row, Get-ShipVerdict, Get-ClientRows,
  Get-MainOnlyRows), against a scratch record, game folder and build, with the
  real Sync-Client.ps1 answering:
    1. A fresh worktree: no engine\skymp at all, the recorded client in the
       game folder. READY.
    2. No matching client anywhere. NOT READY, and the fix names the build
       folder, Sync-Client -Check -Dist and Build-Engine.
    3. A matching build and a game folder that differs: READY, Ship copies it.
    4. A build that is not the recorded one: READY when the game folder holds
       the recorded client, NOT READY when it does not.
    5. The main-only row (the server build, issue #932): none on dev, WARN
       on main, and never a change to the verdict. The setup stub is not a
       row: a main Ship takes the one CI built (test-ship-ci-launcher.ps1).
    6. The script's own text: no row asks for the fork, stale plugins and
       required-data in the game folder are notes (Ship's Go.ps1 step copies
       them in before it checks), and the main-only rows are asked only when
       the channel is main.
    7. Uncommitted changes (issue #1254): on main the line says a main Ship
       refuses while anything is uncommitted, and that row is a gap. On dev
       the line says a dev Ship builds from those changes as they are.
    8. The release folder is a ship root, not an install (issue #2603).
       Get-LauncherRows: on main a folder with no launcher passes, saying
       the Ship puts the one CI built there itself, and no fix says to
       install Thornswood; on dev the Launcher folder, not the exe, is the
       need, as Ship asks it, but only of the install rule's folder: with
       the main launcher's dev build as the fix for <install>-DevBuild,
       where it installs, and recording a folder with Setup-ShipMachine for
       any other; since #2662 a folder named by -Root or recorded passes
       with no Launcher folder, as a dev Ship makes one there itself.
       Get-PackageLauncherRows: a
       warning only, passing when the Ship builds a launcher (another number
       on main's feed), when the folder holds the feed's, and, since #2661,
       when the Ship keeps the feed's and the feed names a whole launcher
       for it to download, check and put there; warning when it names none.
       And the script's text: no "Install Thornswood from thornswood.net",
       no "press Play", and the game folder's fix is Update-ShipRoot then
       Build-Generated.

  Writes only to a temp folder of its own, and removes it.
