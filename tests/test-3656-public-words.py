    python tests/test-3656-public-words.py

Issue #3656. On 27 Oct the #lore and #factions posts and their Changelog
threads went out saying "Patrick confirmed it (#3656)", and #factions "as
Patrick approved them". Patrick, 30 Oct: "the discord changelogs can't have
this", "especially the public sided lore and infomation ones". How the team
decided a change is not what changed, and an issue number means nothing to
somebody reading the Discord or the site.

bot/content.py's NOT_PUBLIC says what a public line never says, and
Build-Discord.py's check_docs refuses to build while a change line or the
live words of a doc say it. That refusal runs only when the Discord is
built, so this runs the same check on every pull request, with nothing but
the standard library. It proves:
  - no change line of any doc, and no live words of a doc, says an issue or
    pull request number or a team member's name;
  - a line saying "Patrick confirmed it (#3656)" is named twice, once for
    the number and once for the name, and a channel name (#lore) is not a
    number;
  - a draft's words are not checked, since a draft is never posted, but
    its change lines are;
  - no page the site shows (site/data/site, lines.md aside, which is no
    page) says an issue or pull request number outside an HTML comment.
Read only. Never connects to anything.
