  CARRIAGE RETURNS OUT FIRST, and this file learned that the hard way.

  Every other harness in this folder starts by stripping them and none of them
  says why. This one did not, and the check below that matches across a line
  break passed on a working copy with Unix endings and failed on the GitHub
  runner, which checks out CRLF: `\n` does not match `\r\n`, so it counted
  zero of fourteen and called a deliberate pattern a slip.

  It is the right failure in the wrong place. Read the file the same way

  ---------------------------------------------------------------- AND ONE THAT

  The list asks to "pick one of notify() or say() rather than sending both".
  Read across the file, that pairing is not an oversight in one place: it is
  the pattern everywhere something has to be seen. notify is Skyrim's own
  corner message and needs no browser; say is the chat, which can be scrolled
  back to and survives the corner message fading. A message that matters goes
  to both on purpose, and changing one of them would make that one the odd one
  out.

  So this check pins the pattern instead. If somebody later decides one channel
  is enough, this is what will tell them how many places agree with them.
