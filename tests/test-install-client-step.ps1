  Install-Thornswood.ps1's client step puts in only the recorded client (#1001).

  The step ran Install-SkyMPClient.ps1, which copied the whole client build
  over the game's Data folder with no look at records\client-build.json, so
  "install everything" could put a client in the game folder that Ship then
  refused, or that was not what the dev server expects. Developer-Guide.md,
  Settled design: Sync-Client.ps1 puts the recorded files in the game folder
  and refuses any that is not the recorded build. The step runs Sync-Client
  now and Install-SkyMPClient.ps1 is gone.

  This lays the real Install-Thornswood.ps1 and the real Sync-Client.ps1 out in
  a scratch copy of the repository's layout, with a made up client build and a
  record of it, and runs the client step (-Only client -NoShip -NoPause) into a
  scratch install:
    - a build with one file that is not the recorded one: the run stops,
      exit 1, and nothing at all is copied;
    - the recorded build: exit 0, the six recorded files are in the game
      folder by sha256, and a file the record does not name is left out;
    - no build and a game folder without the client: exit 1;
    - no build and a game folder that already holds the recorded client:
      exit 0, nothing needed.
  And by reading: the step names Sync-Client.ps1, Install-SkyMPClient.ps1 is
  gone, and no script, test, launcher or installer file names it any more.

  Nothing it runs talks to the VPS, starts a game or touches a real install.
  Everything it writes is in its own temp folder.
