// #1148. The rulebook (#391, THE MAGE EXCEPTION): "At the College each
// semester you can study for two more spell points. Outside the College each
// semester you may choose a school if you have not already got one from a
// master or an earlier semester, and study for one spell point and novice
// spells only." When #1148 was filed, LIMITS.collegeSemester (2) and
// LIMITS.outsiderSemester (1) were read by nothing. #1387 (#1687) built the
// semester; this holds the rules to the rulebook and the pages, and the pages
// to Patrick's answer on #1387 (4 Oct): somebody a Master mage taught needs a
// semester's point and one of their 2 places for each spell.
//
// The behaviour of the Study button, the rooms and the restart is
// tests/test-1387-college.js. This runs the progression block alone.
//
