      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-publish-old-dist.ps1

  Publish-Update.ps1 counts what is left in the old <Root>\_dist folder and
  says so. Measure-Object hands back nothing when no file comes in, and the
  script runs under Set-StrictMode -Version Latest, so reading .Sum off that
  nothing threw "The property 'Sum' cannot be found on this object" and
  stopped a main Ship before anything was published, on a machine whose old
  _dist folder was there but empty (27 Oct 2026).

  This takes the block that does the count out of Publish-Update.ps1 as it is,
  and runs it under StrictMode against:
    1. an empty old folder: no error, and it says 0.0 MB;
    2. an old folder holding one file of 2 MB: it says 2.0 MB;
    3. the old one-line count, on the empty folder: it throws, so this test
       can tell a broken count from a working one.

  Read only: it writes only under its own temp folder.
