//
// The Known Issues text has one copy: the "Known issue:" comment on each
// issue on the board labelled Main Findings or Dev Findings. The bot posts
// those in #known-issues and writes the same list into the site's
// data/from-bot/lists.json, and /known and /api/page/known write that out
// through knownMarkdown in site/server.js.
//
// Issue #2414: the text was kept twice, site/data/known.md for the page and a
// known board that nothing showed. The board went stale: after #504 it still
// said "NPCs stand still when nobody is nearby | SkyMP has no server side AI".
// On 12 October the hub board became the one copy. Issue #3140 then found the
// board and #known-issues saying different things, because one was typed in
// the hub and the other came off the issue board, so the site's page comes off
// the issue board too and the known board is gone.
//
// This fails if a second copy comes back, if the page stops being the bot's
// list, or if the bot and the site stop naming the same file. It also runs the
// page writer on planted lists, and the step Deploy-Docs -Board runs on the
// box on planted boards.
//
// Read only, apart from a scratch folder it removes.
