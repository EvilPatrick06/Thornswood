  test-max-online.ps1

  One number for how many people a server holds at once, in one place
  (entry 281, issue #481).

  WHAT WAS WRONG. The engine's slot count is maxPlayers in
  server-settings.json. Entry 281 set it from MaxOnline in the launcher's
  config.json, a file the launcher rewrites from the feed and each machine
  keeps its own of, and past it RakNet refuses with nothing said and no way
  over it for staff. Patrick, 28 Sep: 25 at once for the alpha, raised later.

  WHAT THIS PROVES.
    1. MaxOnline.ps1 reads records\most-online.json, over every shape of it
       worth trying, and the real record says 25. It refuses a seat count
       the engine will not start with (above 1000).
    2. Set-MaxPlayers writes thornswoodMostOnline (the gamemode's number) and
       maxPlayers (the number plus the staff seats), and leaves both alone
       with no number.
    3. The feed (Publish-Update.ps1) reads the same record, and nothing reads
       a launcher's config.json for it any more.
    4. Deploy-Gamemode.ps1's settings section, lifted by text and run against
       a scratch build folder, writes both keys and keeps every other key.
    5. Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1's block that edits the dev settings on the VPS,
       lifted by text and run by Windows PowerShell against a scratch file,
       writes both keys, keeps the dev port and name, and treats an unknown
       number as nothing to change.
    6. Publish-Server.ps1's block, lifted by text and run against a scratch
       build, writes both keys into what it packs, before the zip is made.
    7. Each channel its own numbers (Patrick, 12 Oct: dev at most 5, in the
       game and in voice, "of 5 awake"; main stays 25 and 5, shown "of 30").
       Get-MostOnline -Channel dev reads the record's dev object, a record
       without one gives dev main's numbers and says so, and each channel is
       held to the engine's ceiling and to voice never under its own seats.
       Deploy-DevGamemode reads dev's, Publish-Server and Publish-Update the
       channel they are run for, and the feed's maxOnline is the seats.

  Nothing here reaches the VPS or reads a real config.json. Read only apart
  from files under its own temp folder.
