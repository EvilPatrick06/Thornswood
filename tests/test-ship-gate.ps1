  test-ship-gate.ps1

  A main release ships what is on GitHub, and nothing else.

  Entry 205 on the list. Ship used to build from the working tree, then
  `git add -A`, commit it and push it to main, which is how a 28 KB audit
  document ended up inside the 1.1.45 release commit. Since f917dd8 on 22 Sep
  Ship commits nothing, and its Git gate refuses a main release with anything
  uncommitted or unpushed. The review of that on 24 Sep found two ways round
  the gate, and this proves both are shut:

  1. A file git has never been told about. The gate counted with
     `git status --untracked-files=no`, so a new file was invisible to it, and
     Go.ps1 copies every game\plugins\*.js into the game folder whether
     git knows it or not. A scratch plugin would pass the gate and go out in
     the pack, which is where the entry's worry ("a scratch file with
     something private in it lands next") had moved to.

  2. -Version on a main release. It wrote a new number into Updater.cs, built,
     published, and nothing committed it or put it back, so every launcher
     would be told a version main had never heard of.

  It lifts the Git gate and the version block out of the shipped Ship.ps1 and
  drives them against a throwaway repository with its own origin, so nothing
  here touches this repository, the network or any launcher. Read only apart
  from files under its own temp folder.
