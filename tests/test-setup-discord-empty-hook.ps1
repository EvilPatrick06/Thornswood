  test-setup-discord-empty-hook.ps1

  Setup-Discord.ps1 ends by handing bot\news-webhook.txt to Discord-Hook.ps1
  -Save. An empty file read back as $null and .Trim() threw on it. This runs
  only that tail, cut out of the real script, in a temp copy of the layout:
  scripts\deploy, the real scripts\ops\Discord-Hook.ps1 and the real
  scripts\vps\Send-Secret.ps1, Send-Script.ps1 and Vps.ps1 (functions only), with scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 swapped for a stub
  that writes down that it was called and contacts nothing. No Python, no
  token, no network, no webhook.

  What it proves:
    an empty file: no throw, says it is empty, nothing reaches the VPS stub
    a whitespace-only file: the same
    a missing file: the old "no webhook was made" lines, nothing sent
    a file that is not a webhook address: Discord-Hook.ps1 refuses it,
      the tail says it is not on the VPS, nothing reaches the stub
