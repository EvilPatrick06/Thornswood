  Issue #3193. Setup-Domain.ps1 stops Caddy in the script it sends to the
  box, and from One ssh to the box goes through the bridge, which goes
  through Caddy. On 21 Oct 2026 (#2995's step A2) the session was cut
  halfway, everything the script said after that was lost, and the run
  ended as ssh's exit 255 though the box had finished. Now the script runs
  on the box on its own, started through WMI so the session ending cannot
  reach it, and writes a report that a fresh session reads once Caddy, and
  the bridge with it, is back: Get-ThornswoodDetachedRun (Send-Script.ps1).

  This checks:
    1. The texts it builds, anywhere: the start writes the script and starts
       it through Win32_Process Create and only then says STARTED; the read
       says REPORT NONE before there is a report; the two files are named
       for the run in the folder given; a folder that would break the
       quoting is refused.
    2. On Windows, both texts run for real in Windows PowerShell 5.1, which
       is what the box runs, with a scratch folder standing for
       C:\Windows\Temp:
         - the run's parent is the WMI service's process, not the
           PowerShell that started it, and it is still going after that one
           has ended;
         - what the script says, its errors too, is in the report in order,
           and the last line is END and the script's exit code;
         - an error that stops the script is an ERROR line and END 1;
         - a script that ends without exit is END 0 even when a program it
           ran last exited 5;
         - the script's file is gone once the run is over, and the read that
           sees END deletes the report;
         - a read while the run has its report open for appending reads it
           and leaves the run able to write (#3233: ReadAllLines did not, so
           a read mid-run made the run's next line fail and end it as END 1);
         - a run whose starting session is still open waits for it to end
           before any of its script runs, and one whose session does not
           end within its limit runs nothing and is ERROR and END 1 (#3214:
           Install-Bridge's run stopped the bridge its own start rode).
  Setup-Domain.ps1's use of it is in tests\test-setup-domain-taskonly.ps1.
  Starts only the Windows PowerShell processes it waits for, in the scratch
  folder it removes; nothing leaves this machine.
