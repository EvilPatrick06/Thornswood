  Issue #2354: the deletes that keep backups to what site/data/site/privacy.md
  promises threw their failures away and logged success. A backup past seven
  daily and four weekly that would not delete was logged "dropped", the task
  ended 0, and Watch-Services.ps1 saw nothing; the copies fetched to the
  operator's machine did the same past 30 days.

  This makes a delete really fail, by holding the oldest backup open with no
  sharing while the real script runs, and reads what is said:

    - vps-nightly-backup.ps1 names the file it could not drop and the kind of
      error, never logs it as dropped, writes it to retention-failed.txt, and
      ends non-zero, while tonight's backup is still made and the other old
      copies still go
    - run again with the file let go, it drops it, removes
      retention-failed.txt and ends 0
    - Watch-Services.ps1's BackupProblem, as the box gets it, says retention is
      failing and names the file while retention-failed.txt is there, and
      nothing once it is gone
    - Fetch-Backups.ps1 -PruneOnly names the copy it could not drop, never
      logs it as dropped, and ends non-zero; then 0 once it goes

  The scripts run under Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is what runs them on the
  VPS. Touches nothing but a scratch folder under the temp folder.
