  test-build-engine.ps1

  scripts\release\Build-Engine.ps1, the script any developer runs to build
  the engine on their own machine (issue #545), and the two reorganisation
  leftovers the 25 September audit found beside it.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The configure line lived only in engine\README.md, typed by
  hand, and Build-Server.ps1 refuses to configure, so no machine but
  Patrick's had ever built the engine and only his could Ship. This holds the
  script to the settings engine\README.md gives and to the fork's own option
  names, and checks that on a machine missing the tools it says so and builds
  nothing.

  It also checks Publish-Update.ps1 hashes the launcher source from launcher\
  (it read tools\ until the audit, and found nothing there after phase 7), and
  that Check-VoiceInstall.ps1 no longer names one person's Downloads folder.
