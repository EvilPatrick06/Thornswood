  test-dev-deploy-warning.ps1

  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 says who is on the dev server and warns them in the
  game before it stops anything. Entry 351 on the To Do List.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. On 23 September that script stopped the dev server six
  times in an hour under Patrick while he was testing, with no word to anybody.
  Every stop is a reconnect and every reconnect is a respawn: "I randomly
  teleportes as I was typing this and I heard the noise of things equipping",
  and then "I did the teleport thing again, it was while looking in the forge".
  The dev server.log has 'gamemode loaded' at 20:39:00 and his worn things put
  back on at 20:39:47, and the same again at 20:44.

  HOW. The warning is a block of functions between two markers in
  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1. This takes that block and drives it with the things
  that would reach the VPS replaced by stand-ins:

    Remote          answers from a list, or runs what it would have sent
                    against a temp folder on this machine, in Windows
                    PowerShell, which is what sshd runs on the box
    Request-Restart a script with the real one's parameter block, so the call
                    binds exactly as it would, which only writes down what it
                    was asked and exits with the code it is told to
    the clock       Get-Date and Start-Sleep, so a minute's countdown takes
                    no time at all

  The rest of the deploy is read, not run: where the warning sits against the
  stop is checked on the parsed script.

  AND A SERVER THAT IS NOT RUNNING. A review on 24 September found the read
  trusted online.json with nothing on the port: {"now":1} left by a killed
  process read as one on, the warning went out to nobody, and restart.json
  sat in the data folder until the next boot counted down on its own. The
  read now runs here with a real UDP socket on loopback standing in for the
  server, and with none. The stop block is taken out of the deploy and run
  here too, against a temp folder, with everything in it that stops a task or
  a process replaced by a stand-in.

  Never connects to anything.
