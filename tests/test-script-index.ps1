  test-script-index.ps1

      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-script-index.ps1

  Ship.ps1 says every option it takes where Get-Help can read it, and
  scripts\README.md lists every script in this folder exactly as
  New-ScriptIndex.ps1 writes it.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Entry 260 on the To Do List. MEASURED 24 SEPTEMBER:
  Get-Help .\scripts\release\Ship.ps1 -Full printed the syntax line and nothing else.
  Ship's header listed five options as if they were all of them, while its
  param block declared thirteen, and the one left out that mattered was
  -Channel, which the whole dev workflow runs on. There were 128 scripts in
  tools, six with a .SYNOPSIS, and nothing that listed them. The entry's
  words: "a list presented as complete is trusted as complete".

  WHY EVERY PARAMETER NEEDS ITS OWN .PARAMETER, and not merely some text in
  Get-Help. Ship's param block has comments in it, written in the leading
  comma style, so each comment sits after the parameter before the one it is
  about. Get-Help gives a comment to the parameter it follows. Measured on a
  copy of Ship.ps1 with the .PARAMETER lines taken out: -Root came out
  described as where releases are staged (the DistRoot comment), -MoveServer
  as the NoPause comment, -NoPause as the AnnounceMinutes one, -NoAnnounce as
  the Channel one, and -Channel with nothing at all. A check that only asked
  whether Get-Help printed something would pass that. So the help block is
  read directly, and each declared parameter must have a .PARAMETER there.
  Three things the help says are also read against the code, because text
  that is merely present can still be wrong: that a main release refuses
  -Version, that it refuses a file in a folder a release is built from that
  git does not know, and that a
  dry run closes a running game.

  The index half runs New-ScriptIndex.ps1 -Check against this folder, which
  is what keeps the list from falling behind, and then drives the generator
  in a temp folder to prove the check goes red when it should.

  Read only. Writes only into a temp folder, which it removes.
