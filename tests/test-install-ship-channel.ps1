  Install-Thornswood.ps1 never Ships live (#1171).

  Its publish block calls Ship.ps1 with only the parameters Ship actually has.
  Before this fix it passed Root and NoPause and never Channel, so Ship used
  its default Channel=main (the live release). Developer-Guide.md sends every
  ordinary change to the dev build first.

  This harness reads Install-Thornswood.ps1 and holds that:
    - the publish block sets shipArgs Channel to dev when Ship has Channel
    - it never sets Channel to main
    - the recovery note names Ship.ps1 -Channel dev
  It does not run Install or Ship.
