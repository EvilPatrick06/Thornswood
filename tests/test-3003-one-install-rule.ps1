  The rule that finds the launcher install lives in one place, Where.ps1's
  Find-InstallRoot, and every script asks Where.ps1 Install or InstallDev for
  it.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #3003. Until 21 October six scripts each carried a
  pasted Find-Root (Publish-Update, Repair-Manifest, Sync-Client, Go,
  Deploy-Gamemode and Check-CollectionRules), and Check-Editions a seventh
  copy written out inline, each pasted from the one before. A change to the
  rule had to be made seven times, and tests\test-feed-rules.ps1 held five
  of the copies word for word against each other, which kept them alike and
  kept them copies. Five of them also stopped off Windows: their first line
  asked Join-Path for C:\Thornswood, and Join-Path throws "Cannot find drive"
  on a machine with no C:. #2989's pull request had just changed
  Check-CollectionRules's copy by hand for that, one copy of seven.

  AND EVERY SCRIPT, issue #3031. Moving the seven left about forty scripts
  that took C:\Thornswood, or a folder under it, as a fixed default instead
  of asking, so on a developer whose launcher is on another drive they read
  or wrote a folder that is not the install unless the path was typed each
  time. Each script had been written with Patrick's own install as its
  default before there was one place to ask, and nothing stopped the next
  one. They ask Where.ps1 now, and part 3 holds every script to it.

  THIS FAILS ON:
    1. a function named Find-Root or Find-InstallRoot in any script outside
       Where.ps1;
    2. any script outside Where.ps1 that walks the drives for
       Launcher\Thornswood.exe, the rule itself under another name or none
       (a Get-PSDrive call and that file name in one script);
    3. one of the seven scripts not asking Where.ps1 Install, or any script
       writing an install folder (C:\Thornswood, C:\Thornswood-DevBuild or
       a folder under either, on any drive) into a string of its own. Left
       out: Where.ps1, whose rule starts there; installer\Setup-Thornswood.ps1,
       which chooses where a new install goes; scripts\oneoff, parked and not run
       (its README); and tests, whose folders are made up. The box's own
       folders (C:\Thornswood-Server, C:/Thornswood-Docs and the rest) are
       not the install and are not read as one;
    4. Where.ps1's rule answering wrong on made up drives, or Install and
       InstallDev not answering as the rule says.
  The readers in 1, 2 and 3 are run over planted scripts first, one per way
  of copying the rule or writing the folder, so a reader that finds nothing
  anywhere cannot pass.

  Read only. The planted scripts are parsed from strings, not written.
