// Whisper, local and yell actually carry different distances, and the handoff
// to the launcher lets go of the socket.
//
// TWO ENTRIES ON THE TO DO LIST, and they are in the same file for the same
// underlying reason: something was being set that nothing read.
//
//   "Whisper, local and yell all carry the same distance, because the page
//    changes a number WebAudio does not read." The three modes were applied by
//    writing refDistance and maxDistance onto a panner whose distanceModel is
//    'inverse', and the inverse model DOES NOT READ maxDistance. Only the
//    linear model does. So nothing ever stopped being audible at any distance,
//    and a yell was not louder than a whisper standing in the same place.
//
//   "Relay mode never leaves the room, because the method it calls does not
//    exist." enterRelay called n.leave() behind an `if (n.leave)` guard, and
//    thornswoodNet has never had a leave. The guard was always false, so the
//    page carried on being handed every voice message on the shared socket and
//    rebuilt the peer connections it had just dropped.
//
// Both of those are invisible from the outside: a number that is ignored and a
// guard that is false both read exactly like working code. So this drives the
// REAL functions out of the page rather than reading them.
//
// Read only.
