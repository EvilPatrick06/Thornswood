// The door locks stopped running sixty times a second without losing a door.
//
// From the To Do List: "The door locks re-lock every door on the list sixty
// times a second... updateOwner scripts run every frame in skymp5-client, not
// on change. Three scripts ride that channel. The swing and the skills panel
// were both fixed; the door locks were not, and deliberately, because that one
// may be LOAD BEARING... WHAT IS NEEDED is to find out whether the re-runs are
// actually what catches a late door, or whether the separate door tick that
// comment mentions already does it."
//
// IT IS LOAD BEARING, and the answer was in the file. The script's own comment
// says "a door in a cell nobody has loaded does not resolve... the tick below
// comes back to it", and there is no tick below: pushAll says "Done on a
// change rather than on a tick: a lock is changed a handful of times a day and
// there is nothing to poll for." So the re-runs were the only thing that ever
// caught a door whose cell streamed in afterwards, and a plain edge trigger
// would have left those doors unlocked with nothing anywhere to notice.
//
// So it keeps running again, on a four second heartbeat instead of every
// frame, and a CHANGE is still instant. This file runs the real script against
// a fake clock and a fake game to prove all three of those at once, because
// the failure being guarded against is a door that quietly never locks.
//

  Entry 330, step 1. Both halves of a front door answer with the house in
  BUILDING_BY_DOOR, so shutFor locked the inside half as well, and a guest or
  a burglar inside when the holder locked up found every way out locked. The
  refusal in onActivate then refused the same door if the client lock had not
  run. Measured against doors.json on 24 September: 3,326 of the 4,891 doors
  stand inside their own building, in 812 of the 852 buildings, and 124 more
  stand in a room, a cellar or a lodging, whose only road to open ground is
  through the building.

  This runs the real shutFor, mayPass and doorsOf, and the real refusal lifted
  out of onActivate, against a small house, and then checks the generated
