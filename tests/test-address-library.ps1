  The Address Library row on the launcher's Play page. To Do List entry 264:
  "The launcher never checks the Address Library, so a whole class of failure
  reads as green".

  WHY IT MATTERS. Script extender plugins look the game's addresses up in
  Data\SKSE\Plugins\versionlib-<build>.bin, and one that needs it and cannot
  find it does not load. EngineFixes says "failed to locate an appropriate
  address library" and stays out. Setup-Thornswood.ps1 has tested for the file
  all along; the launcher's nine rows never did, so the Play page read all
  green while those plugins stayed out of the game.

  THE ROW IS ADVISORY. It turns amber and never shuts Play. A new row that
  blocks and is wrong on somebody's machine locks them out with nothing they
  can press, so these check that a failing Address Library row leaves Play
  alone as hard as they check that it fails.

  WHICH FILE. The row names the file from SkyrimSE.exe's own version, because
  that is how the plugins name it when the game starts. Measured on
  24 September: C:\Thornswood\Game\SkyrimSE.exe reads 1.6.1170.0 and
  versionlib-1-6-1170-0.bin (795,129 bytes) is the file beside it.

  WHAT IT SAYS TO DO. Missing on the right build, the fix is the collection
  in Vortex, the words the join page uses. Missing on the wrong build, the fix
  is the downgrade, because the launcher keeps the collection card down until
  the build is right and the row must not send somebody the other way.

  This lifts class Check and the three AddressLibrary methods out of the
  shipped Checks.cs by text and compiles them with the same .NET Framework csc
  Build-Launcher.ps1 uses, so what runs is the shipped code under C# 5 rather
  than a copy of it. The fake game folders get a SkyrimSE.exe built by that
  csc with a version resource of the build under test.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder. It reads
  C:\Thornswood\Game when it is there and says SKIP when it is not.
