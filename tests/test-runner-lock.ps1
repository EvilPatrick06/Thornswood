      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-runner-lock.ps1

  Several build runners on the VPS, and each one's folder shut to the others.

  WHY. On 4 October a second runner went on the box beside the first
  (Install-Runner.ps1 -Number 2 names). Its install shut its own account out
  of every C:\Thornswood-* folder, the first runner's included, and nothing
  shut the first runner's account out of the second's folder, which did not
  exist when the first was installed. A folder made under C:\ lets BUILTIN\Users
  read it, every runner account is in Users, and a runner's folder holds the
  credentials GitHub gave it. So each runner's folder is now locked the way
  #1105 locked the server folders, and -Lock puts every runner on the box
  right without replacing any of them.

  CRASH DUMPS (#2127, #2488). Lock-VpsFolders.ps1 gives every runner account
  write and no read on C:\Thornswood-Dumps (Patrick, 11 October), and until
  12 October every install and -Lock put a full deny on it for every runner,
  which beats that write. This pins that Install-Runner leaves exactly the
  folder Lock-VpsFolders.ps1 names to it, that no other deny is in the
  script, and, on scratch folders with the real Lock-VpsFolders.ps1, that the
  lock takes an old deny off, says so, and keeps the write.

  HOW. Reads Install-Runner.ps1 for the names -Number gives and for where the
  locks run. Then, on Windows, lifts the real Lock-RunnerRoot and
  Close-RunnerAccount out of the script and runs them on scratch folders
  under TEMP, never under C:\, and reads the rules back. The account shut out
  is ANONYMOUS LOGON (*S-1-5-7), a principal that is never the one running
  this, so the scratch folders stay this account's to remove. Off Windows the
  scratch part says SKIP.
