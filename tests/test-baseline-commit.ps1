  test-baseline-commit.ps1

  A Ship sends the baseline it moves to the VPS, so the next Ship on any
  machine starts from it.

  MEASURED 27 SEPTEMBER. Publish-Update writes published.json after the feed
  goes out, on purpose, and nothing committed it. The 18:55 dev release left
  it modified in Thornswood-Releases-dev, and the 19:02 Ship stopped on
  "cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes" with nothing published.
  That was fixed by committing it as "Baseline <id>". Since #907 the baseline
  is not in a git clone at all: it lives on the VPS beside the feed
  (scripts\release\Feed-Store.ps1), and Send-Baseline sends it there.

  This lifts the block between the baseline send markers out of the real
  Publish-Update.ps1 and runs it against a scratch folder standing in for the
  VPS store:
    1. after a release, published.json is on the VPS and the old one is kept
       in history
    2. -NoPush sends nothing
    3. a baseline another Ship moved up there meanwhile is not overwritten,
       and the release is not failed for it
  and reads the order in the script: the baseline is saved and sent only after
  the feed was sent, and never when the feed send failed.

  Read only apart from its own temp folder.
