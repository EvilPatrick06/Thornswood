// A ban does not depend on somebody spelling a role name correctly.
//
// From the To Do List: "site/server.js:75 expects a role named Banned...
// Build-Discord.py builds the role list and Banned is not in it. Entry 30 is
// the enforcement; this is the fact that the thing being enforced does not
// exist yet."
//
// TWO HALVES, AND THIS CHECKS BOTH. The builder makes the role now, so a
// moderator has something to reach for in Discord. And the site reads a
// bans.json of Discord ids, so the ban survives somebody renaming the role,
// the bot being out of the guild, a guild lookup failing, and the branch for
// "no bot configured yet" which used to hand play to everybody.
//
// The file half is what this drives, by lifting the block out of server.js and
// running it, because that is the half a typo cannot break.
//
// Read only.
