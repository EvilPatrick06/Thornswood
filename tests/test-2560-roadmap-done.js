// test-2560-roadmap-done.js
//
// #2560: the public roadmap drifted from the board twice after #2561.
//   1. The #502 row still promised bounties, though #502 was rewritten on
//      12 Oct (no bounty at all) and #2472 removed the bounty system.
//   2. The Done rows #2561 added never reached /roadmap, because both
//      renderers (home.js and server.js's server-drawn page) skipped any
//      section named Done.
// Since #3140 the roadmap is built from the issue board, so the first cannot
// come back the same way: a row's words are its issue's "Roadmap:" comment.
// Since 26 Oct the bot writes no Done lane at all (Patrick: "Done section
// needs removed from the roadmap"), at its source, bot.py roadmap_once. The
// renderers still draw every lane they are given, in order, with no filter
// by name, so the bot alone decides the lanes and a lane can never again be
// written and not drawn: this plants a Done lane to prove that.
