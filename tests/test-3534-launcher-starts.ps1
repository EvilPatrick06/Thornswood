  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #3534. The weekly review could not measure the
  launcher's start time, because nothing did. Now the launcher writes one
  line once its window has drawn (Shell.cs, LogStartTime), the site keeps it
  with each session's launcher.log, and scripts\vps\Read-LauncherStarts.ps1
  totals a week of them on the box.

  What it checks:
    1. the launcher writes the line in the words the reader reads, after the
       window has drawn, timed from the process's own start, with the mod
       check's time taken around RunScan, and through LogOnly, which puts
       nothing on the status line;
    2. the reader, run against session log sets made here: it counts each
       start once although the same launcher.log comes in several sets, keeps
       two accounts' starts at the same second apart, leaves out a start
       before the window and a set written before it, counts a set that will
       not read and goes on, says the middle, the one slower than nine in ten
       and the slowest per launcher version, says "not written" for a mod
       check an older line lacks, prints no account, and says so when there
       are no starts;
    3. on Windows, the same run in Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is what the
       box runs it in.

  Nothing connects anywhere. Everything it writes is in its own temp folder.
