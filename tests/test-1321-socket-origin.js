  #1321. The voice service never read a socket's Origin, so any website
  could open sockets to it from its visitors' browsers: on 5 Oct, against
  main, a handshake with Origin https://evil.example was answered 101 and
  its join welcomed.

  This starts the real service in a temp folder and makes raw handshakes
  with the Origin and Host a browser would send, proving:

    a page on another website is refused with 403, before any 101, and the
    socket is closed;
    so is a page on this host at another port, a look-alike host, and an
    Origin that is not an address at all;
    so is a page on this very host, asked straight (Host 127.0.0.1:port) and
    through Caddy (Host thornswood.net, Origin https://thornswood.net,
    X-Forwarded-For set): the service's own page was let in that way until it
    went (#1822), and nothing else of ours is served from there;
    the game's pages and the launcher's voice page, loaded off disk, say
    null or file:// and are let in, and join;
    a client that sends no Origin, which is not a browser, is let in and
    joins, as every harness does;
    a refused page that hangs up as it is answered does not stop the
    service;
    and the refusal is in the log once, not once per socket.

  VOICE points it at another copy of voice-server.js, which is how it was
  shown to fail on the code before the change. Writes only to a temp folder,
  on a loopback port the system hands out.
