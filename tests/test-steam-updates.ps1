  Steam's Updates setting for Skyrim, which nothing in the launcher read or
  set until 24 September (entry 271 on the To Do List, "Nothing stops Steam
  putting Skyrim back on the wrong build").

  WHY IT MATTERS. The downgrade puts the 1.6.1170 files in place, and Steam
  still believes the game is on the newest build. Unless its setting says to
  wait for a launch, the next Skyrim update Steam takes by itself undoes the
  downgrade. The only protection was a log line asking people not to start
  Skyrim through Steam. The setting is "AutoUpdateBehavior" in
  steamapps\appmanifest_489830.acf; 1 is "Wait until I launch the game" in
  the Automatic Updates list on Steam's own Properties, Updates page.

  STEAM'S OWN WORDS. The first version named choices Steam no longer shows
  ("Only update this game when I launch it", "Always keep this game
  updated"), and a review caught it. Measured on Patrick's machine on 24
  September: steamui\localization\steamui_english-json.js (8 August) names
  the four choices "Use global setting", "Wait until I launch the game",
  "Immediately download updates" and "Let Steam decide when to update", and
  the UI bundle, steamui\chunk~2dcc5aaf7.js, numbers them 0, 1, 2 and 3.
  Where this machine has Steam, the names and numbers are checked against
  those two files, so a rename in a later Steam shows up here.

  MEASURED 24 SEPTEMBER on Patrick's machine, read only: that file is 1156
  bytes of Valve's KeyValues text, tabs and LF, "AutoUpdateBehavior" "0", and
  it carries the ReadOnly attribute, the only one of twenty manifests there
  that does. Steam was running.

  WHAT THIS HOLDS THE LAUNCHER TO. A broken manifest is worse than an unwanted
  update, so only the value's bytes may change, anything not shaped the way
  Steam writes it is left alone, and nothing is written while Steam runs.
  Play is never held on it.

  THE LAUNCHER WRITES IT ITSELF (#493, Patrick, 29 September: "Our Repo
  should write this so it doesn't auto update the game and people have to re
  do the downgrade again"). On the way in, with Steam closed, it is written
  with nothing to ask; with Steam open, a question whose Yes closes Steam,
  waits for it to be gone, writes and starts Steam again, and whose No is
  remembered. The same question follows every downgrade that works.

  WHY THE READ-ONLY MARK IS NOT NEEDED FOR THE GAME (measured 29 September,
  read only): Thornswood runs its own folder, whose exe, root files and
  masters are its own copies, and Steam commits an update by moving whole new
  files into the Steam copy (content_log: 8.8 GB staged, committed in the same
  second), so an update cannot reach the game Thornswood runs. What it would
  cost is the Steam copy, and so a second downgrade; the setting prevents that.

  A READ-ONLY FILE IS LEFT WRITABLE (issue #493). The read-only mark is how
  some guides hold the version, and it makes Steam fail to save the game's
  state in the file every six seconds (11,568 "Failed to write app state
  file" lines in Patrick's content_log.txt on 29 September). The setting is
  what holds the version, so Hold takes the mark off, a file already on 1
  that is only read only gets the mark taken off with its bytes untouched,
  the start line says when a file has the mark and how to take it off by
  hand, and nothing in the launcher puts it back.

  It compiles the shipped launcher\app\SteamUpdates.cs with the compiler the
  build runs (tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1), and drives the
  real class. Where this machine has Steam and Skyrim, it also parses the
  real manifest, without writing to it.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
