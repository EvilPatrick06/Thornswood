//
// The three files that say how work reaches main say what GitHub and the
// scripts actually do.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Entry 232 on the To Do List, first opened as "the review
// routine both documents describe has never happened, and the settings exempt
// the only person it would bind". Branch protection on main changed twice on
// 22 September, and each time the documents were a step behind. Read off GitHub
// on 23 September: enforce_admins on, one required check "Launcher builds",
// required approving reviews 0, code owner review off. CLAUDE.md was corrected
// in #196. Developer-Guide.md still said a main Ship commits and pushes the
// source when the release is out, and that the other person reads every pull
// request. .github/CODEOWNERS still said Patrick's own work goes straight to
// main and never becomes a pull request. CLAUDE.md itself still said a main
// Ship commits and pushes the source, one bullet above the paragraph saying
// Ship writes nothing to the repository. With enforce_admins on, a push
// straight to main is refused, so all of those described something the
// tooling will not allow.
//
// So this checks two things. First, the facts the documents lean on, read off
// the files that decide them: build.yml has one job and it is "Launcher
// builds"; Ship.ps1 never writes to the source repository; Bump-Version.ps1
// commits Updater.cs and nothing else; CODEOWNERS names files that exist and
// covers the six shared ones CLAUDE.md lists. Then the documents: each states
// the four settings (since 25 September: enforce_admins off, no required
// check, since the build check on GitHub is off), gives
// the command that reads the live settings, and says none of the things that
// stopped being true.
//
//     node tests/test-branch-rules.js           the files only, no network
//     node tests/test-branch-rules.js --live    also reads branch protection
//                                               off GitHub with gh and checks
//                                               the documents against it
//
// The --live read is a GET and changes nothing. CI does not pass it: the
