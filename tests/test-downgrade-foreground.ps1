  The Downgrade button brings Steam's window to the front for a later part
  too, when the person has gone to another program since the button was
  pressed, and never joins a window that has stopped answering.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. A tester on launcher 1.1.94, 25 September. Part 1 was
  typed into Steam's console and came down. Twenty minutes later the launcher
  opened the console for part 2 and typed nothing (Patrick: "it correctly put
  the first command in it finnished and than it redid the open console command
  and stopped"). Part 1 is asked for with the launcher in front, the moment
  its button is pressed. Part 2 is asked for when the person is somewhere
  else, and BringToFront's two ways through, joining Steam's input thread and
  a tap of Alt, do nothing then when the window in front is one our keys
  cannot reach. The foreground belongs to the window in front, so that is the
  thread to join.

  HOW. BringToFront, SteamInFront, ForegroundIsSteam, IsSteam and InFront are
  lifted out of launcher\app\Downgrade.cs by brace match and compiled with the
  compiler the build runs (tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1), against a
  stand-in desktop. Nothing here focuses a window or sends a key.

  The stand-in follows Windows' rule for SetForegroundWindow as Microsoft
  documents it, reduced to the cases this code meets: the call goes through
  when the window is already in front, when the caller is the process in
  front, when the caller's input is joined to the thread in front, or when
  the last input came from the caller (the Alt tap), unless the window in
  front is one the caller's keys cannot reach. That is a model of Windows,
  not Windows, and it is the rule the code has to get through.
