  #1223. The live join pass hold and the written role lists change only when
  the person deploying asks for it in that run, never because a build holds
  them.

  WHY. Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 -RequirePass, -Devs and -Playtesters wrote
  thornswoodRequirePass, thornswoodDevs and thornswoodPlaytesters into a
  machine's build, the build is read back and added to so they stayed there
  for good, and Deploy-Server.ps1 took them from the build as release keys
  ($ThornswoodGamemodeKeys). A build on a second machine given -RequirePass
  off a week before turned the live hold off on its next Deploy-Server, with
  nothing said but the key's name.

  It proves:
    1. ServerSettings.ps1 lists none of the three among the keys taken from
       a build, and names them as the keys a run asks for.
    2. A build holding an old thornswoodRequirePass, and old role lists, does
       not change the live server's: the carry on the box (the real
       $settingsCarryBlock, with the lines Deploy-Server puts in front of it)
       keeps live's and says so.
    3. -RequirePass on|off, -Devs and -Playtesters, as Deploy-Server turns
       them into the line the box runs, set them in the carry, and say so;
       asking for what live already has says that instead.
    4. Swap.ps1's read-back, handed the keys Deploy-Server hands it, lets an
       asked key move and stops on one nobody asked for.
    5. Deploy-Server.ps1 takes the switches, hands the asked keys to the
       carry, the check and the swap, and refuses them with -PutBack before
       anything goes to the box (run whole, with ssh and scp stand-ins).
    6. Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 takes none of the three, writes none of them, and
       takes an old one out of the build.

  Nothing leaves this machine. Scratch files go under the temp folder.
