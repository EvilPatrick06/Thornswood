  test-action-pins.ps1

  Every GitHub Action the workflows run is named by a full length commit SHA,
  with the tag it was on in a comment on the same line.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Part of issue #437, which moved the checks onto a runner on
  the VPS, and of #578. A tag on an action is a moving pointer: whoever owns
  the action can repoint v7 at any commit, and nothing in this repository
  changes when they do. These jobs run on the VPS, in a local account beside
  the live server, so a repointed tag is somebody else's code on that box with
  no commit here to read. release.yml was written pinned and says so
  ("a moved tag on an action cannot change what runs"); build.yml and
  nightly.yml were not, and ran actions/checkout@v7 and
  actions/upload-artifact@v7 until this.

  So this reads .github\workflows and fails on any `uses:` that is not a
  40 character SHA, on a pin with no tag in its comment, and on the same action
  pinned to two different SHAs in two files, which is how one workflow quietly
  stays behind. The same reader is then driven over workflows written out in
  its own temp folder, so a reader that finds nothing wrong anywhere cannot
  pass by accident.

  It never reaches GitHub, so it says nothing about whether a SHA still exists.
  Moving a pin is looking the tag up and replacing both halves:
      gh api repos/actions/checkout/git/matching-refs/tags/v7

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
