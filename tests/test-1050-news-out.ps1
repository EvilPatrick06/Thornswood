  The notes leave version.json for a file of their own once every launcher a
  channel lets in reads one (#1050), and every script that adds, marks or
  reads them finds them there.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured 12 Oct over https, the news was 31,282 of main's
  95,085 bytes of version.json and 19,980 of dev's 111,305, read by every
  launcher on every check. Every launcher up to 1.2.3 reads the News tab only
  out of "news"; from 1.2.4 on it also reads "newsFile" (launcher\app\
  FeedNews.cs). scripts\release\Feed-News.ps1 is the one place that decides
  which a channel uses and reads either. What this proves, on a stand-in site
  folder (-SiteDir), nothing sent anywhere:
    - Test-FeedNewsOut: from 1.2.4 on, dev numbers included, and never for a
      minimum that is not a version
    - below it the notes stay in "news" and the feed names no file
    - from it the notes are one asset under their sha256, named as newsFile
      { url, sha256, count }, "news" written as [], and the site holds the file
      before the feed would name it
    - Get-FeedNewsList reads the file back, after the notes "news" carries,
      each note once; Open-FeedNewsList puts the whole list in "news" and takes
      the file out, so a trimmed note never comes back; the list keeps forty
    - a file the site does not hold, or a newsFile of another shape, stops a
      script rather than letting it write back a list without its older notes
    - Dev-News's marks read every note through it
    - Publish-News, which copies the notes to the site's News page, reads a
      feed that keeps them as a file
    - Publish-Update, Rollback-Feed, Publish-Server, Publish-Discord and
      Remirror-Site-Feed go through it (read from their source)
