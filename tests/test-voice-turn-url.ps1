      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-voice-turn-url.ps1

  Install-Voice.ps1 can hand the voice service a relay address, keeps it on
  the next install the way it keeps -Bind, says so when it drops one that has
  no key, and with no relay sends the service the command line it always
  sent, but for auth, which is on on every line since #1303.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The To Do List entry "Voice is a full peer-to-peer mesh
  with no relay and no cap, and the code already admits a pair that cannot
  connect is simply lost". Step one there is a TURN relay, and the voice
  service has been able to hand one out since the ICE list moved into it, but
  Install-Voice.ps1 built the service's whole environment from -Site, -Port,
  -Bind and -Auth, so no relay address could ever reach the running service.
  Its key does not go this way at all: it sits in turn-key.txt beside the
  service, which voice\test-turn-key.js covers.

  Nobody has stood up a relay yet, so the first thing held here is that an
  install without one is the same install, to the character.

  HOW. Install-Voice.ps1 reaches the VPS the moment it runs, so it is parsed
  and never run. The pieces that decide the relay are lifted out of its syntax
  tree and run here:

    the shape      what a relay address may look like, since it goes onto a
                   cmd.exe line where an & would start a second command
    the probe      what is already running, read through a stand-in Remote.ps1
                   that runs the probe in Windows PowerShell on this machine,
                   which is what sshd runs on the box, against real copies of
                   voice\voice-server.js started here on spare ports
    the command    the service's command line, built from the install's own
                   here-string, then run through cmd.exe against a stand-in
                   voice-server.js that writes down the environment it got

  Never connects to anything off this machine. Writes only under its own temp
  folder.
