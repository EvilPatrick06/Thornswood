// test-fire-walk.js
//
// Walking into a new cell must not throw out of the place tick.
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED. The dev client's front log for 23 September,
// C:\Thornswood-DevBuild\Game\Data\Platform\thornswood-front.log, has 80 lines
// of
//
//     place threw: ReferenceError: walked is not defined
//
// between 20:08 and 21:00, and not one "fires: N of ours in this cell" line.
// #184 moved the fire probe off Game.findClosestReferenceOfType and onto a
// walk of the cell, and the line fireSpotsHere logs at the end of that walk
// named `walked`, which was the counter inside the walk. Its own is
// fireWalked. So every cell change threw after the fires had been kept, the
// place tick died before it composed its line, and the /place report for that
// tick never reached the server. The tick after it read the kept list and got
// through, which is why nothing looked broken from the outside.
//
// test-temp.js reads this code as text, and text that names a variable which
// does not exist reads exactly as well as text that names one that does. So
// this RUNS it: the real CELL_TYPES, walkCellSlice, the fire state, fireIdList,
// fireSpotsHere and fireDistance, lifted out of the plugin, over a fake cell
// and a fake sp. The fire table is a stub of two real Skyrim.esm bases, because
// the table is data and the walk is what is under test.
//
// THE CLOCK IS THE HARNESS'S (#2581). The walk stops once FIRE_SLICE_MS (2 ms)
// has gone by performance.now, which is right in the game, where the slice is
// a frame's budget. Run on the real clock here, a busy machine spent the 2 ms
// before the walk had read the fake cell's four references, and S1 read a walk
// that had not finished: 11 passed 8 failed one run, 19 passed the next. So
// the lifted code is handed a performance of the harness's own, whose time
// moves only when the harness moves it. S1 to S4 test the walk on a clock that
// stands still; S5 moves it a millisecond for each reference read and checks
// that the slice does stop once its time is spent, and that the walk finishes
// over the next slices with the same answer.
//
// NO CLOCK DECIDES A WALK (#2590). Two timers sat around this walk: an empty
// cell was walked again every 8 s, and bases that resolved to nothing were
// asked for again every 4 s, over a load race nobody had measured. A cell is
// now walked again only when the engine says the cell underfoot has finished
// loading (cellFullyLoaded, fireCellLoaded), and the bases are resolved once.
// The lifted code gets the harness's clock for Date.now as well, and S7 to
// S10 move it by hours between asks: a walk or an ask on a clock shows up.
// Against the plugin with the two timers, S7, S8 and S10 fail.
