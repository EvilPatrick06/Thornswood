  test-play-collection-refresh.js

  Play offers the same Vortex bring-up-to-date Diagnostics does.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The Diagnostics button BtnOwnGameRefresh runs
  StartOwnGame(false), which is OwnGame.Refresh when Vortex has deployed
  since the folder was made (OwnGame.NeedsRefresh). Play never asked
  NeedsRefresh. It checked ownGameBusy and launched. A collection Vortex
  had already deployed while the launcher was open went into the game
  from the last refresh.

  This holds the cause to the source:
    - StartPlay asks OwnGameRefreshIfDue before Discord and before Play();
    - Play() asks it again, because Play() is also the path a running game
      and other callers come through, and the button being grey does
      nothing for those;
    - OwnGameRefreshIfDue is StartOwnGame(false, true), the same call as
      BtnOwnGameRefresh, not a second refresh;
    - when NeedsRefresh is false, StartPlay still reaches Play();
    - when the bring-up-to-date succeeds, StartPlay runs again, so one press
      ends in the game, and only once, so a folder that still does not match
      cannot send it round again;
    - ownGameBusy is read again after the wait, because a bring-up-to-date
      OwnGameAtStart queued can start inside it;
    - a NeedsRefresh that throws is said in the log, not only noted.

  Read only. It reads source files and nothing else.
