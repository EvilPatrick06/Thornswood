      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-updater.ps1

  The launcher's updater, asked its own questions.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Six functions in launcher\app\Updater.cs decide what counts
  as an update, where one may come from, and which files a pack may write or
  delete: IsNewer, Parts, Inside, ClaimedElsewhere, Pending and
  CheckUrl. Each has the incident that shaped it written above it, and until
  this nothing ran any of them outside a live launcher. The To Do List entry
  put it as "the easiest thing in the codebase to test and the most expensive
  to get wrong, because it decides what gets downloaded and where it is allowed
  to be written". test-dev-version.ps1 carries a PowerShell copy of IsNewer,
  which answers for the copy and not for the launcher.

  HOW. It compiles launcher\app\*.cs into a library in a temp folder, with the
  same csc, the same /noconfig and the same references Build-Launcher.ps1
  uses (the names are read out of Build-Launcher.ps1 itself, so the two cannot
  drift), loads it, and calls the functions by reflection. Updater is a
  private static class, and reaching it this way means the launcher's source
  does not change for the sake of a test. Nothing in the launcher runs: no
  Main, no window, no network. Pending and ClaimedElsewhere read applied.txt
  and the Packs folder, so Paths is pointed at the temp folder for those two
  first, and nothing under C:\Thornswood or the profile is read or written.

  It runs under Windows PowerShell 5.1 and restarts itself there when started
  from pwsh, which is how the build check starts it. The launcher runs on the
  .NET Framework, and Uri and Path are not promised to answer the same on the
  runtime pwsh carries.

  -Src points it at another copy of the sources. That is how it was shown to
  catch what it is for. MEASURED 24 SEPTEMBER: eight bugs put back into a
  scratch copy of Updater.cs one at a time, and every one turned this red.
  IsNewer as a plain "different" test (7 checks fail), Parts reading letters
  as 0 (7), RepoCandidates forgetting the new name (1), Inside as a plain
  prefix (4), ClaimedElsewhere counting a pack's own list (3), Pending ignoring
  applied.txt (1), CheckUrl matching a host suffix without its dot (1), and
  CheckUrl taking plain http (2).

  KNOWN lines are behaviours that look wrong and are left for Patrick to
  decide. They print what the launcher returns today and are not counted
  either way, so fixing one does not turn this red.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
