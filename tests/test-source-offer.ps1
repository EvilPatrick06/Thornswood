  test-source-offer.ps1

  Where the source of the SkyMP files Thornswood ships is, said on the site and
  in the installed folder, and said truthfully.

  WHY IT MATTERS. Entry 170 on the To Do List. The setup and every pack
  carry six files built from SkyMP (records\client-build.json), and the server
  runs a seventh (records\server-build.json). SkyMP's folders carry the GNU GPL
  and AGPL version 3, each in its own LICENSE file. Nothing Thornswood put in
  front of a stranger said where the source was: credits.md named SkyMP with
  no licence and no link, and on 24 September the installer's READ ME
  FIRST.txt was still the old multiplayer mod's one, left in the setup program's
  scratch folder. The entry's closing condition: a stranger can reach,
  "from the download page and from inside the installed folder", a page
  naming skymp5-client, skyrim-platform and skymp5-server with their licences
  that links the corresponding source.

  MEASURED 24 SEPTEMBER. git ls-remote against the public fork with no
  credentials answers 3cbf2f8779f5 for thornswood/engine-changes, the commit
  both records named that day, and the tree, compare and upstream links on the
  page all answer 200 signed out. Both records name the pinned commit since
  #1200, and this file reads them rather than holding a commit of its own.

  NOT ALL OF IT IS OURS. The 23 September installer stage also carried
  Data\Platform\UI\build.js (a webpack build of skymp5-front, GPL v3, dated
  13 September, before the fork), Data\Platform\Modules\skyrimPlatform.ts and
  Data\Scripts\MpClientPlugin.pex, none of them built here and none with a
  recorded commit. The first version of the page and the note said "All of
  it is built from" the fork, which was false. Both now name those files as
  their own group, say the gap, and point at upstream, and this checks that
  they do and that the old sentence does not come back.

  What this checks:
    - the setup's SOURCE CODE.txt, Source-Notice.ps1's note of kind setup,
      which Build-SetupFiles.ps1 writes into the launcher's Velopack package
      from the client record and the game files it packs (#4824, #4825;
      Package-Thornswood.ps1's Get-SourceNotice until then): it names every
      recorded file, follows the record when it changes, and stops on a
      file it has no source folder for. It names the SkyMP files carried
      that were not built here, as their own group, and only those present.
      The server is not in the package, so the note does not name it; the
      credits page does.
    - the install (InstallSteps.cs) copies that note and the licence texts
      into the install folder, and Uninstall.cs takes them out again.
    - credits.md names the fork, the branch, the recorded commits and every
      shipped file. A commit that is not in a record fails here. The two
      channel rows name no commit: the site fills in each feed's client
      commit, and test-credits-channels.ps1 holds that to each feed.
      It names the files not built here apart, with the gap said.
    - the download page points at it.
    - with the fork on this machine, every licence and every file to folder
      pair both notices state is read off the fork itself at the recorded
      commit. SKIP where the fork is not cloned, which is the build runner.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
