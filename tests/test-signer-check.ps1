  The check a launcher runs on a downloaded launcher before it goes in
  (launcher\app\Signature.cs, which the Velopack update asks in VeloPackage.cs
  and VeloUpdate.cs since #4825), pointed at real files.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #912. Until then the check read the Subject of the
  embedded certificate (X509Certificate.CreateFromSignedFile) and looked for
  the signer's name in it. That call verifies nothing, so a certificate anybody
  can make on their own machine with that name passed. This proves the new
  check on each file it has to decide:

    accepted  the real signed dev launcher (by default
              C:\Thornswood-DevBuild\Launcher\Thornswood.exe), and a copy of
              it in another folder.
    refused   an unsigned exe; the same exe signed with a self-made
              certificate named as the signer, and with one that also copies
              every usage Thornswood's real certificate carries; a program
              validly signed by another publisher (csc.exe: Refusal refuses
              it, it is not Thornswood's identity); a program signed
              through Artifact Signing by another publisher (Git for
              Windows), even asked for its own name; the real launcher with one
              byte changed; the real launcher asked for another identity or
              another name.

  For the self-made certificate it also runs the old Subject read, to show
  that one passed (the bug this closes).

  A Windows file signed only in a catalog, with nothing in the file, is
  refused as not signed. Trust asks WinVerifyTrust with WTD_CHOICE_FILE, so
  catalogs are never honoured (#2046). (Signature.MicrosoftRefusal, which
  voice asked before it ran the WebView2 installer, #1330, went with the web
  view in #4823, and its checks here with it.)

  The self-made certificates are made with New-SelfSignedCertificate in the
  CurrentUser store, used once, and removed from every CurrentUser store
  before this ends, whatever happens. Nothing is trusted, nothing is written
  outside its own temp folder, and nothing touches the network except what
  Windows itself asks for to check revocation.

  When the signed launcher is not on this machine (the VPS), the cases that
  need it say SKIP and are not counted; the refusals are still proved.

  It also runs scripts\release\Assert-PublishSigned.ps1's gate on the same
  files, because Ship and Publish-Installer must refuse whatever the launcher
  would.

  Builds Signature.cs with the .NET 10 SDK the way the launcher project
  does (tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1) and runs it in this PowerShell, which is
  .NET 10 as the launcher is. Windows PowerShell 5.1 compiles the same file
  with Add-Type when Assert-PublishSigned.ps1 runs there (the box's check
  from Sign-OnGitHub.ps1), so that compile is run too. Windows only: the check
  is WinVerifyTrust, and the certificates are Windows' own store.
