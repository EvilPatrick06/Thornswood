  Issue #2019. A Ship never packs a folder that can be stale.

  WHAT WAS WRONG, measured on One on 15 Oct. The dev ship root
  (local\release-devbuild) was a launcher install whose launcher is never
  started, so its Game folder was still the one made on 3 Oct: OwnGame rules
  14 against the code's 16, made from C:\Thornswood-DevBuild\Game rather than
  Vortex's deployment, the collection's old 3BBB.esp in it, and the 12 Oct
  client. Ship read the client from the worktree's own engine\skymp\build,
  also 12 Oct, and refused twice. Main had no ship root of its own, so a main
  Ship packed C:\Thornswood, Patrick's own install.

  WHAT IT HOLDS.
    1. The ship root tool (scripts\release\ShipRoot), compiled from the real
       OwnGame sources with its own two files, on a pretend Steam, Vortex and
       root in a scratch folder:
       a. a new main root is made the way an install that chose its own
          folder is: config.json for main, Thornswood's own files synced from
          the channel's release into Payload (the sync stood in for), Make,
          Payload gone, and the folder current;
       b. the same root made at older rules from another folder, after Vortex
          deployed a new copy of a plugin (One's dev root on 15 Oct): -Check
          says it was made from another folder and changes nothing; a run
          brings it up to date, the plugin is Vortex's new bytes, made.txt
          names the folder Vortex deploys into at the current rules, and
          Thornswood's own file is still there;
       c. Vortex deploying again is seen by -Check and taken in by a run;
       d. refusals, each with nothing changed: the other channel's root, a
          folder Vortex deploys into, a Game folder OwnGame did not make,
          -Check on a root that is not there.
       e. #2603, a Steam copy that is not 1.6.1170 (a cleaned master, as
          One's has another Dawnguard.esm): a new root is refused as an
          install's Make refuses it; -SkyrimFrom naming a folder with a
          listed file missing, or an archive of the right size with other
          bytes, is refused naming that file, with no game folder made; a
          folder holding them all makes the root, with the game's own files
          copied from it (a write into the new root's master leaves the
          source's as it was), the Steam copy's cleaned master nowhere, a
          Creation Club plugin the folder never takes not asked for, and
          made.txt naming the folder; a refresh keeps that line, and
          -SkyrimFrom on a made root is said and not used. A file of the
          source that changes after it was checked stops Make (the stamp
          check, called as Make calls it).
    2. Where.ps1 and where.js: with no record ClientDist and ServerDist are
       under the checkout's engine\skymp; with Setup-ShipMachine's record they
       are under the recorded fork's build, for every clone; a record naming
       a folder with no build stops with a sentence and never falls back.
    3. Update-ShipRoot.ps1, the real script with a stand-in tool: a tool that
       refuses stops it, naming why; a client build that is not the record
       stops it; the recorded build goes in, through a file that had a second
       name without writing through it, and it ends current. -SkyrimFrom is
       handed to the tool, whole, and never with -Check (#2603).
    4. Setup-ShipMachine.ps1's Save-EngineBuild writes the record and refuses
       a folder with no build in it; Ship.ps1 runs Update-ShipRoot.ps1 for
       the channel's root before the version moves and before anything is
       built, and stops when it refuses (tests\test-ship-dry-run.ps1 runs that
       Ship, N). Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 takes -SkyrimFrom and hands it to
       Update-ShipRoot.ps1, not with -Check.

  Nothing outside its own scratch folder is written. Needs the Build Tools'
  csc (tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1) and node.
