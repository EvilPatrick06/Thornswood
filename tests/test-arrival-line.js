//
// The move to the inn at the end of creation is said to the person, once.
//
// WHY. The To Do List's entry on narrating creation: the first minutes are "a
// stone room with nobody in it, a race menu, silence, an unexplained teleport".
// arriveAt is the teleport. It set the spawn point, moved the character, wrote
// "home = whiterun" to the server's own log and said nothing to anybody, so the
// person got a load screen and a room they had never seen.
//
// Only the arrival. Patrick, 21 September, on a creation line that described
// what was already on the screen: "that is chat spam and is unnescery". Which
// other steps of creation get a line is his call, so this holds the one line
// and nothing more.
//
// So this lifts the real arriveAt out of gamemode.js by text, and the real town
// table beside it, and runs it against a stand-in mp that records what was
// said. GM points it at another copy of the file, which is how it was shown to
// fail on the code before the change.
//
// Read only.
