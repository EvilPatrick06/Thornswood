  Issue #2233. Build-Generated counted every SkyrimSE.exe, skse64_loader.exe or
  launcher whose path it could not read as holding the folder. On the VPS the
  four build runners are four accounts, so one runner's stand-in Skyrim stopped
  another runner's build. Such a process now counts only when one of the
  install's own programs is running, which is told from the folder's side: a
  running program's file cannot be opened for writing.

  WHAT IT CHECKS. Test-ImageRunning and Get-RunningInstallImages, lifted from
  scripts\mods\Build-Generated.ps1 with PowerShell's parser, over a scratch
  install under the temp directory:
    1. a copy of ping.exe named Game\SkyrimSE.exe, running: running, and listed
    2. once it has exited: not running, and nothing listed
    3. a missing file, and a read-only file nobody runs: not running
  And in the text of Get-FolderUsers: an unreadable process is no longer
  counted on its name alone, only while an image from the folder is running.
