  test-publish-refusals.ps1

  The publisher refuses, whole and for real, the releases it exists to refuse.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. 17 September: an uninstall test removed Profile from the
  machine that ships. Profile\OwnGame\files.txt, the only record of which
  files in the game folder came from Vortex, went with it, and the next
  release counted "29,063 added or changed (11,368.1 MB)" before it was
  stopped by hand. Two refusals answer that now: no record, no release; and
  no release over the size cap. Entry 197 on the To Do List asks for "the
  publisher refuses without files.txt" as a test, and nothing ran either one.

  So this runs the real Publish-Update.ps1, in a child PowerShell, against a
  made up install in a temp folder, and reads what it did:

    no files.txt                   refused, naming files.txt
    a files.txt naming nothing     refused
    a release over -MaxReleaseMB   refused by the size gate, nothing zipped
    the same with -AcceptSize      goes past the size gate
    a release under the cap        goes past the size gate

  Every run also checks that the feed and the baseline are byte for byte what
  they were, because a refusal that has already written either one is the
  dry run fault of 17 September over again.

  WHY IT IS SAFE TO RUN ANYWHERE. The script is copied into the temp folder
  with the two files it dot-sources, and the third, Close-Launcher.ps1, is
  replaced by a stub: the real Stop-Game closes any Skyrim on the machine,
  whatever folder it runs from, and nothing here may do that. LOCALAPPDATA
  points into the temp folder for pending notes; the feed and the baseline are
  in a stand-in working folder under -ReleaseDir, so the real ones are never
  read or written. -NoUpload and -NoPush with both files already there, so
  Feed-Store.ps1 receives and sends nothing, and no config.json: it cannot
  reach the VPS or a server. Every case stops before the pack is built.
