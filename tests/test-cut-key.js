// A smith can make a key.
//
// Patrick, 23 September: "Smith's are supposed to be able to make a key", after
// "A smith can't craft a key it seems so I can't test the property system line
// properly", and then, plainly, "I littarrly said you can't make a fucking key
// but you're supposed to be able too".
//
// He was right, and the shape of the rule was the reason. Every key came off a
// mold; a mold is only cut at the door of a building somebody already holds,
// with that holder standing there. A smith alone had no way to a key at all,
// and neither did anybody else: the ceremony needed two people before it would
// produce the first one.
//
// What this checks is that the fix did not spend the balance it was protecting.
// A mold is still the only way to a key for a door you do not hold.
//
// Read only.
