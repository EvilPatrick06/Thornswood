//   13:35:33  chargen ff000056 -> appearance (already in the hall)
//   13:41:55  disconnect 2
//
// Six minutes and nothing in between. The five minute give up should have
// fired at 13:40:33. It could not: every rescue in the appearance stage sat
// under `if (!state.liveSince) { continue; }`, and liveSince is only set when
// the server watches somebody MOVE. A person stuck at a menu, on a load
// screen, or in a race menu that never opened is by definition not moving, so
// the rescues written for exactly that person were the ones they could never
// reach. A playtester described the same evening from the other side.
//
// chargentest.js beside this covers the new-or-returning decision and has 17
// checks, none of which go near this, which is why it passed throughout.
//
// This lifts the appearance stage out of the shipped file and drives it with a
// clock. Nothing is stubbed that decides anything: the stage is the real text.
