  #998: Patreon's About text is pasted by hand from the To Do board's
  "every word to paste" section in site/data/board.json, so the repo copy is
  the only one anything can check. It has to:
  A. say nothing about a closed playtest (the words #428 retired),
  B. carry a closing line for each state of the site's open switch, and
  C. say for each state what the bot's join panel says for that state, so
     Patreon cannot claim the world is open while Discord asks for an
     application, or the other way round.

  #2828: Bethesda's terms for mods forbid money for making mods, so
  D. the blurb, the terms page and the classes page all say the Patreon pays
     for the server, the domain and other expenses, and none of them says it
     pays for the time that goes into building Thornswood.
