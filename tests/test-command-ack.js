/*
  test-command-ack.js

  Entry 290: the command channel between the plugins and the server had no
  acknowledgement, and dropped the oldest on overflow.

  Every slash line and every plugin report (/face, a swing of the axe, a
  broken lockpick) goes from the chat socket into the voice service's queue,
  and the gamemode collects it over loopback every second and a half. Two
  ways that lost commands with nobody told:

    GET /commands emptied the queue in one splice before the gamemode had
    read the answer, and poll() parsed it inside a catch that returned. A
    batch that failed to parse, or an answer lost to the timeout, was gone.

    A full queue shifted the OLDEST off the front, without a word, to make
    room: a command already taken vanished.

  So this proves, against the real service spawned in a temp folder and the
  real poll() lifted out of gamemode.js by text:

    a command asked for with ?ack=1 is still there on a second GET, until an
    acknowledgement takes it away;
    a plain GET still empties the queue, so a gamemode from before this
    change is never handed the same command twice;
    the retry is bounded, and giving up is logged;
    a full queue refuses the newest, keeps the oldest, and tells the sender;
    poll() acknowledges only what it ran, never after a parse failure, runs
    an id offered twice only once, and against a service from before this
    change (no ids) runs everything once and acknowledges nothing;
    and end to end, a typed command runs once and leaves the queue empty.

  GM and VOICE point it at other copies of the two files, which is how it was
  shown to fail on the code before the change. Read only apart from its own
  temp folder and two loopback ports the system hands out.
