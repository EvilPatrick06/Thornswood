  The engine recorded in CI (#459): the shape of .github\workflows\engine.yml,
  and the part Build-Engine.ps1, Build-Server.ps1, EngineJobs.ps1 and
  Bootstrap-VPS.ps1 play in building the engine.

  WHY. Patrick decided on 15 Oct: the engine is built on GitHub's hosted
  runner first, and on the VPS runners when that is refused ("C, then B"),
  the way the build check falls back (#2407). Each piece of that is a line of
  YAML or a line of a script that a later edit could drop without anything
  else going red: the fallback's condition, the manual start (a pull
  request's code reaches the box through build-pr.yml alone, #1306), the
  image the fork's generator needs, the steps that make
  the records a pin pull request takes, the cleanup that keeps four runners'
  build folders off the box's disk, the CI=true the fork's CMakeLists.txt
  reads, and the SKYRIM_DIR a runner does not have. Since Patrick's B of
  16 Oct, also the fork's own build taken first: the LF checkout, the look
  for it before anything compiles, every compile step skipped when it is in,
  and the records made from it naming the fork's run (section 3b;
  tests\test-459-fork-build.ps1 runs ForkEngineBuild.ps1 and -BuiltBy).
  Since Patrick's A on #3014 (22 Oct) the box compiles nothing, and since
  his A on #3399 (26 Oct) neither does GitHub's runner: a Ship machine takes
  the fork's own build, so with no fork build of the commit both jobs stop
  and say why (section 3c runs that step's own text), and the records come
  back in the job's log, not as an artifact of this repository, whose
  storage was used up (section 3d; tests\test-3399-engine-records.ps1 runs
  the hand-back).

  Read only, apart from a child pwsh that dot-sources EngineJobs.ps1 and
  Build-Engine.ps1 -Check against an empty folder, which changes nothing. Runs
  anywhere pwsh runs; nothing is built.
