      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-script-paths.ps1

  Every path a script builds from its own folder or the repository points at
  something that is in the repository, apart from the files that are made at
  run time or kept out of git on purpose, which are listed below with why.

  WHY. The repository is being reorganised in phases (issue #440 on the
  board), and the scripts that build a release find what they ship by joining
  a path onto their own folder. Build-Launcher, Package-Thornswood and Go.ps1
  only warn in yellow when one of those files is not there, and carry on, so
  a move that missed one path would ship a launcher without its art or a
  pack without its overlays, and nobody would notice until a tester did. This
  turns that into a failed check before anything is built.

  HOW. Every script under scripts\ and every harness in tests\ is read as
  text for Join-Path $Here, $PSScriptRoot, $RepoDir or $Repo with a single
  quoted path, which is how every script here names its neighbours. A path
  with a variable or a wildcard in it is not followed. tools\ went on
  29 September (issue #440, phase 10), so nothing is read from there. Read
  only.
