// test-1269-kept-character.js
//
// A person whose saved character the server could not read is made a new one
// and told once, on joining, that the old one was kept.
//
// WHY. Issue #1269. On the dev server ff000005 was skipped at every start
// because its race could not be read, and the next new character was given
// its id and saved over the file. Fork PR 33 keeps such a record on disk and
// never reuses its id; the fork's getUnreadableChangeForms(profileId) says
// which records of a profile were kept. Patrick, 5 October: the person gets a
// new character under a new id and is told once, on joining, that the old one
// was kept.
//
// This lifts the real tellKeptCharacter, its line and its property, and the
// real created() out of gamemode.js by text, and runs them against a stand-in
// mp: an engine with the binding, one without it, one whose binding throws,
// and a record write that does not stick. GM points it at another copy of the
// file, which is how it was shown to fail on the code before the change.
//
// Read only.
