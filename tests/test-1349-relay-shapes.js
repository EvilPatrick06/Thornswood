  #1349 and #1350, one cause: the voice service passed on what a page sent
  as it came.

  #1349, the name. A join's name was kept as sent, cut to forty characters.
  On 5 Oct, against main, the name "Bob", a line break, and
  "[voice] REFUSED a join for profile 1" printed a log line the service never
  wrote. The command the name rode beside was never at risk, because the
  gamemode does not read the name off a command; this holds that too.

  #1350, the signalling. sdp and ice messages were passed on with every
  field the sender put in them, and one with no description reached handlers
  that read m.sdp.type and threw.

  This starts the real service in a temp folder and proves:

    a hostile name comes out of the join with no control characters, line
    or paragraph separators or direction marks, at most forty characters,
    in the roster, on a chat line, beside a command, and in the log, where
    it can no longer start a line of its own;
    an ordinary name with accents, an apostrophe and a hyphen is kept as is;
    the command it rides beside is exactly what was typed, and the
    gamemode reads no name off a command;
    an offer and a candidate reach the other page as t, from, to and the
    description or the candidate's own fields, and nothing a page added;
    from is always the sender, whatever the sender wrote;
    and signalling of any other shape reaches nobody.

  VOICE points it at another copy of voice-server.js, which is how it was
  shown to fail on the code before the change. Writes only to a temp folder,
  on a loopback port the system hands out.
