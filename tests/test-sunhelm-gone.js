// test-sunhelm-gone.js
//
// Nothing a customer reads still sends them to a mod that has left the
// collection, and what the help says about the needs is what the server
// actually does.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. To Do List entry 133. Settled by Patrick on 17 September,
// in the entry's words: the mod does not matter, the three needs do. So
// SunHelm Survival and SunHelm Diseases came out, and hunger, thirst, rest and
// temperature were built on the server instead. Respawn - Death Overhaul and
// Tavern Games came out in the same release, and Immersive Armors became its
// script free build.
//
// The removal was done and the server half was live, and the words were not.
// On 24 September the launcher's Help page still said "The needs display is
// configurable in the SunHelm MCM" and promised that "a bedroll or a hot
// drink" warms you, which nothing on the server counts. The Controls page
// said "SunHelm and the older mods live here". Add-CartTravel.ps1 said fast
// travel was switched off by SunHelm, when it is the SkyMP client that does
// it. Every one of those sends somebody looking for a thing that is not there.
// known.md listed all five mods as "in the collection" too; entry 280 fixed
// that table, and since #3137 the page names none of them: a mod taken out on
// purpose is not a known issue.
//
// So this reads the text people read and checks it two ways: it names no mod
// that has gone as though it were still here, and where it describes the
// needs, everything it promises is something gamemode.js does. It checks what
// the text claims rather than the words it uses, so a rewrite of the help
// passes as long as what it says is true. The help it reads is the panel in
// the game since #3146 cut the launcher's Help page.
// On a machine
// with the game built it also checks the entry's doneWhen: no SunHelm in the
// reference plugin list, the game folder or the client's load order, and the
// script free Immersive Armors in its place. On a runner with no game folder
// those say SKIP.
//
