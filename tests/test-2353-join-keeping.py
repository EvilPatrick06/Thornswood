    python tests/test-2353-join-keeping.py

Issue #2353: the bot kept which arrival each Discord account was in
joins.json for ever, after its person left too, and the privacy page did not
name it. Decided by Patrick on 12 Oct: a keeping time for each store,
enforced in code. A number is now kept while its person is in the Discord and
for JOIN_KEEP_DAYS (365) after they leave.

joins_age is lifted out of bot/bot.py by its source and run on its own, so
this needs neither discord.py nor a token and runs on every pull request; the
nightly runs the bot's own tests against the whole module. It proves:
  - somebody numbered and not in the server is marked left now, once;
  - somebody marked and in the server again is unmarked;
  - a number whose person left more than 365 days ago goes, with its mark,
    and one that left 364 days ago stays;
  - 'last' is never touched, so no number is handed out twice;
  - a server whose member list is not whole is never marked, only aged;
  - a mark that is not a time is left, with its number;
and that the deletion request, the hourly watch and arrival_number all use
the marks. And (#3620) that age_restore_copies deletes a joins.json a restore
set aside 30 days after the time in its name, in a scratch folder, and the
hourly watch runs it. Synthetic ids only; nothing outside the scratch folder
is written.
