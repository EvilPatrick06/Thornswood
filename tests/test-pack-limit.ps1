  test-pack-limit.ps1

  A pack is one zip, and the publisher does not say a host refuses it.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Publish-Update.ps1 used to split a release so each part
  stayed under a 2 GiB release-asset cap, and it said so by naming that host.
  Since #897 and #907 every pack goes to the site by scp
  (/feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>). Nothing on that path caps one asset, so the
  split and the refusal are gone. This reads the script and checks the pack
  section, and the release-size note beside it, no longer name that host or
  keep the old cap.

  It does not run Ship, does not publish, and does not need the game or
  C:\Thornswood. Read only. Never connects to anything.
