  test-session-cards.js

  The /sessions page groups by person, not by session.

  Asked for by Patrick on 22 September: one card a person, closed showing the
  Discord name, the id, total playtime and when they last played, and open
  showing every session they have had. The note column came off at the same
  time.

  The arithmetic on that closed card is the part worth a test, because it is
  the part that can be quietly wrong and still look right:

    - total playtime counts only the sessions that reported an END. A row with
      no end carries no minutes, so counting it would make the hours disagree
      with the session count on the same card. The same rule the week's totals
      already use, for the same reason.
    - the NEWEST name wins. Somebody who changed their Discord name should show
      the name they have now, not the one they had on their first session.
    - a row with no Discord id makes no card at all, rather than a card with an
      empty heading.

  This lifts the real functions out of the shipped page by text, so a rename
  fails loudly rather than testing a copy of the logic.

  Read only. It opens one file and runs no server.
