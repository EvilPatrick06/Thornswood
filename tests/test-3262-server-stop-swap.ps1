  Issue #3262. On 22 Oct 2026 at 4:30 AM a dev Publish-Server stopped the dev
  server (three processes, each waited for until it had exited) and was
  refused the rename of C:\Thornswood-Server-Dev with a sharing violation,
  0x80070020, while nothing it asked named a holder. The same had happened
  on 21 Oct at 4:24 PM (#3131). A sharing violation on a folder is a handle
  on the folder itself, a process's current directory the usual one, and the
  three processes the installer ended were the only ones that had it.

  This runs the installer's own stop and swap, ten times, against what the
  dev server's task runs, so a stop that leaves anything holding the folder
  is caught where it can be looked at:

    1. The installer's task command line ($cmd) is read out of
       Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1, and so are its ServerProcesses and
       StopServer, and StopAndMove.ps1 is loaded; all of them as they ship.
    2. On Windows, in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the box's, which the installer
       runs in), ten times: a scratch server folder with the real
       Server-Log.js as server-log.js and a stand-in server in dist_back
       that holds a file, watches its folder and writes lines, started by
       cmd.exe with that command line and the folder as its working
       directory, exactly as the task starts it. Once the stand-in has
       written, StopServer finds the same three processes the box's dev
       server has (cmd.exe, server-log.js, the server), ends them and waits
       for each, and the folder is renamed at once through
       Move-ThornswoodPath. Each rename must go through. One that is refused
       prints what Get-ThornswoodPathHolders said, which names the holder.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder, and the cmd.exe and
  node processes it starts there and ends.
