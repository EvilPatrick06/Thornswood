/*
  test-session-logs.js

  The logs kept against one session, which are meant to stand up when somebody
  is suspended or banned.

  Asked for by Patrick on 22 September: collect the logs so he never has to ask
  for them, and so they can be used as evidence later. Three things follow from
  "evidence" and each of them is a check here, because each can be quietly
  wrong while the feature still looks like it works:

    WRITE ONCE. A second set for the same session must not overwrite the
    first. Without that, anybody who knew the endpoint could do something worth
    banning for and then post a clean set over the top from the same launcher,
    and the evidence would be whatever the accused chose to send last.

    PROVENANCE. The Discord id is taken off the TICKET, never off the body, and
    a sha256 of every log is recorded, so a copy pasted into an argument months
    later can be held against the one on the box.

    KEPT BY AGE, NOT BY THE ROLLING LIST. sessions.json keeps the last two
    thousand rows. Tying the logs to it would delete the evidence for an old
    incident the moment two thousand newer sessions had happened.

  It also checks what the endpoint REFUSES to store, because this is a body
  from every launcher and a file name is the shortest way into a folder nobody
  meant to write.

  This lifts the real functions out of server.js by text, so a rename fails
  loudly rather than testing a copy. Read only apart from its own temp folder.
