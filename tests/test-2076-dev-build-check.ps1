# Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 sends a gamemode only onto the server build its
# commit records (#2076), the comparison Deploy-Server -GamemodeOnly makes for
# live (#1089). Main since #2060 records engine 9fd1f69b and its gamemode no
# longer handles drops (#1719); both servers ran 720a5f7c, so a dev deploy from
# main would have lost every dropped extra on dev.
#
# Get-ThornswoodBoxBuildProblem (ServerBuild.ps1) is called with stand-in
# record sums, and the script is read for where it asks: before the artifact
# leaves this machine, and not on -PutBack, which sends no gamemode.
# Read only. Nothing connects to anything.
# Scripts this runs whole go to a stand-in box, so the freshness guard lets them be (#2118).
