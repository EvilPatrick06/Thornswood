  test-downgrade-asks.js

  The Downgrade button asks before it takes over Steam's window.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Downgrade.Start opens Steam's console, brings Steam's
  window to the front, clicks 72 pixels above its bottom edge, sends Ctrl+A
  and Backspace, types a download_depot line and presses Enter twice, once
  for each of three depots. Until 24 September the button went from the click
  straight to that, with no question of any kind: To Do List entry 273, "At
  minimum a Continue or Cancel dialog saying exactly what will be typed and
  that Steam's window will come to the front".

  The button cannot be pressed from here (CLAUDE.md forbids starting the
  launcher), so this reads the source and checks the shape that makes the
  question impossible to go around:

    - Downgrade.Start is called from one place in the launcher, RunDowngrade,
      and RunDowngrade is reached from one place, the button;
    - inside RunDowngrade a Yes or No question comes before Downgrade.Start
      and before the button changes, and anything but Yes returns;
    - the lines the question shows come from Downgrade.Commands(), and Run
      types the same strings, so the two cannot drift apart;
    - the words follow the house rules and match the card's own size.

  Read only. It reads launcher\app\*.cs and launcher\ui.xaml and nothing else.
