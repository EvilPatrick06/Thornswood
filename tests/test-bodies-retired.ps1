  Add-Bodies.ps1 refuses to run, and nothing still runs it.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #405 (entry 221 on the To Do List): the female body
  in the game folder is the fully nude 3BA mesh, and the script that put it
  there puts it back every time it runs. MEASURED 24 SEPTEMBER:
  femalebody_0.nif and femalebody_1.nif in C:\Thornswood\Game\Data hold the
  shapes 3BA, 3BA_Vagina and 3BA_Anus and no Bra or Panty. The script poured
  CBBE's "00 Required" and 3BA's "00 Base" straight over those two files, and
  they are Vortex hard links now (Profile\OwnGame\files.txt records them as
  L|V), so a run also wrote into Vortex's own staging copy, which the settled
  design forbids. It was still a step in Run-Everything.ps1.

  The covered body arrives the way every other mesh does, through the Nexus
  collection, which is Patrick's. What the repository can do is make sure no
  script of ours undoes it, and that is what this holds: the script throws a
  STOP before it touches anything, a run against a scratch game folder leaves
  that folder byte for byte as it was, and Run-Everything.ps1 no longer calls
  it. Pattern from #735 Add-TempleRespawn, #768 Add-JContainers and
  Add-Characters.ps1, whose refusals tests\test-sunhelm-gone.js holds.

  On a machine with the game built it also reads the shape names out of
  femalebody_1.nif, the check the issue gives. Until the collection revision
  carries the covered body that part says SKIP, with what it found, rather
  than failing a harness over a step no code can take.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
