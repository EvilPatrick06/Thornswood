  test-publish-server-channel.ps1

  A dev Publish-Server packs the dev ports without leaving them in the local
  build, and a live one packs 7777 or nothing (#1114).

  WHY THIS EXISTS. A dev publish (-Channel dev) rewrote the build's own
  server-settings.json in place, to port 7787, voice 7789 and the name
  Thornswood Dev, with Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 (a byte order mark under
  Windows PowerShell), and never put it back. The next live publish without
  Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 in between packed those for the live server, and the run
  said only that the server did not come up.

  HOW. The real Publish-Server.ps1 and Export-ServerPayload.ps1 run in a child
  PowerShell against a scratch build, with ssh and scp stand-ins first on PATH
  (they write down what they were asked and say INSTALL OK), and a listener on
  this machine standing in for the resources port the run probes afterwards,
  on a port from the system that it holds for the whole run (#1728):

    1. a dev publish: the zip starts the server on 7787, voice 7789, named
       Thornswood Dev, with no byte order mark, and the build's own settings
       are byte for byte what they were
    2. a live publish straight after: the zip starts it on 7777
    3. a build left on the dev ports by an older dev publish: the live publish
       refuses before anything is sent
    4. -SkipBuild with a dev zip on the live channel: refused, nothing sent
    5. Export-ServerPayload.ps1 by itself, the same way round
    6. a binary that is not the build the record names (#1214): refused
       before anything is sent, by a publish on either channel, by -SkipBuild
       with a zip made from it, and by Export-ServerPayload by itself; a good
       zip carries the record, for the installer to hold it again
    6b. every other server file the same way (#1214): a JavaScript half from
       another build beside the recorded binary, a -SkipBuild zip carrying
       one, a server file the record does not list, and a record that lists
       only the binary are each refused before anything is sent; a good zip
       carries every recorded file and nothing the build folder holds that
       is not part of a release
    7. a build whose npcSettings has a "default" key, which refuses every NPC
       (#1222): refused on either channel before anything is sent; a dev zip
       says thornswoodServer dev, and a live export of one that says dev is
       refused; ServerSettings.ps1 goes up beside the installer

  Run under whichever PowerShell runs this file, so running it under both
  checks both. Nothing here connects to the VPS.
