  Issue #2215. The game has started again within three seconds of closing 17
  times since 20 September, and only the Play button reaches StartPlay from
  outside. Nothing recorded what pressed it, so this is the measurement: every
  press writes one line to launcher.log naming the input.

  WHAT IT CHECKS, in launcher\app\Shell.cs (text only):
    1. The Play button's Click handler logs PlayPressedBy() before anything else.
    2. PlayPressedBy names the mouse, the keyboard (with the last key down on
       the window) or no device, whether the window was active, and the seconds
       since the last game closed.
    3. The game's close sets gameClosedAt, and the window's handlers, seen on
       the way down before any control (RoutingStrategies.Tunnel), keep the
       last key and note whether the mouse or the keyboard was used last.
       Avalonia keeps no record of the last input device, so these handlers
       are what PlayPressedBy reads.
