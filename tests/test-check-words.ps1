  test-check-words.ps1

  The writing rules in CONTRIBUTING.md are checked, and the check itself works.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Entry 237 on the To Do List, issue #460: "The repo's own
  writing rules are written down and nothing enforces them." MEASURED 24
  SEPTEMBER, before scripts\dev\Check-Words.ps1 existed: eleven hits in the
  files people read. MEASURED 29 SEPTEMBER, when the check still read only ten
  named files: a person's name in the installer setup README had held
  test-component-readmes.js red on main for a day (#1034, #1040, #1061) with
  this build green, because only the nightly run read component READMEs, and
  the word the rules ban sat in a README, the script index and the site's
  gallery page, which nothing read at all. So the check now reads every
  Markdown file and every public page, and this proves every rule in it.

  And one trap measured while writing the check. The first draft spelled the
  em dash as a regex escape; the tool that wrote the file turned the escape
  into the character itself, and Windows PowerShell 5.1, which reads a script
  with no byte order mark as ANSI, then found none of the six em dashes that
  were there, while PowerShell 7 found all of them. So this runs the check
  under both, on the same seeded files, and asks for the same answer.

  What it proves:
    - the repository as it stands passes;
    - every rule (em-dash, banned-word, old-owner, open-alpha, placeholder,
      names-person) reports a break planted for it at its own file and line,
      and every hit names the file, the line and the rule;
    - nothing that is allowed is reported (multiplayer, playtest, getPlayer,
      an en dash, the certificate's name, a gavin/ branch, a repository link),
      nor anything in lore\, docs\archive\ or a code file;
    - an allowance covers exactly its line; one that matches nothing, names a
      rule that is not there or is missing a part is itself a hit;
    - in a checkout, only the files git tracks are read;
    - the check exits 1 on a hit and 0 when clean, and writes nothing;
    - its own source is plain ASCII, so no editor can change what it matches.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
