//
// The terms page says exactly what of Bethesda's Thornswood hands on, and
// since #2827 that is nothing. Issues #2792 and #2827.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 19 October terms.md said "Thornswood ships no game
// files", while every pack and the installer carried Data\Interface\
// startmenu.swf, Skyrim's own interface file edited (#2177), and the notice
// board and drop box meshes, built from pieces of Skyrim's own (#2502). The
// page was written before those shipped, and nothing compared it with the
// pack list. Patrick picked on 19 Oct to make the page exact (#2792, option
// 1), and then to stop shipping the three and have the launcher make them
// from each person's own game (#2827, option 2). This holds the page to the
// pack list from now on:
//
//   1. no file Ship-Rules.ps1 $ShipOursFiles ships has a register entry
//      (records\asset-provenance.json) that says Bethesda made it, or that it
//      was built from Bethesda's;
//   2. the three the launcher makes from the game are not in $ShipOursFiles,
//      are in $ShipMadeFromGame, and the register says so;
//   3. the page says Thornswood ships no game files, and names each file
//      made from the game, so nobody reads a file in their game folder as
//      one Thornswood handed them;
//   4. the page and the credits page carry the line Bethesda's terms for
//      mods ask for (Creation Kit licence 2.B);
//   5. the checks catch a shipped Bethesda file and a page that no longer
//      says none ships, on planted copies.
//
// Read only.
