  The retired dresser, thornswood-chargen.js, is out of the repo, nothing that
  installs or ships the game names it except the rules that keep it out, every
  pack deletes it from the machines that already have it, and the launcher's
  own game folder does not copy it back in from the Steam copy afterwards.

  WHY. To Do List entry 127. On 20 September the dresser was found putting the
  best armour it could find into every empty slot five seconds after any pack
  change, which is Patrick's "it is auto equipping things sometimes, like a
  hat". It was retired that day (c529c67) to print one line and do nothing, and
  the entry left the rest as "delete the file and the four scripts that name it
  (Install-Emotes, Install-Thornswood, Revert, Check-Chargen), which is a small
  tidy".

  There were two copies, not one. game\plugins is where Ship takes the
  plugins from. tools\emotes is where Install-Emotes.ps1 and Revert.ps1 took it
  from, and that copy was the dresser from BEFORE it was retired, with no
  whose-game gate and its equipItem call intact, so running either script put
  the hat back on people.

  THE COPY THE LAUNCHER WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK. Found in review on 24
  September, while the first version of this harness passed 19 of 19. The
  Steam copy on Patrick's machine still has the dresser from before it was
  retired: 11,654 bytes, dated 16 Sep, pc.equipItem at line 210 and an update
  handler at line 238. Profile\OwnGame\files.txt in both roots lists it as
  C|O|11654, which is the launcher's record that the game folder's copy was
  built from that Steam copy file. OwnGame.Foreign called any thornswood-*.js
  ours, so once a pack deleted the game folder's copy and Keep.Forget the kept
  one, the next refresh found the name missing and copied the 16 Sep file in,
  and Keep.Seed took it for a kept copy at the next launcher start, because
  the 17 Sep and 20 Sep pack records list it and its time is older than
  theirs. Keep.Restore then put it back before every Play. That is the hat
  again. The first version read the O in that record as good news; it is the
  evidence that the Steam copy has the file.

  What it checks:
    1. Neither copy is in the repo, and no script, launcher source or plugin
       under tools names it, apart from OwnGame.cs and Ship-Rules.ps1, which
       name it to keep it out. Harnesses are left out of that search, since
       this one has to.
    2. Go.ps1's sweep of the plugin folder, lifted by text and run against a
       scratch folder, takes a leftover copy out and leaves ours and the
       client alone. Ship runs Go.ps1 into the shipping machine's game folder
       before it scans, so this is what takes it out of the folder a pack is
       made from.
    3. Ship-Rules never ships it and puts it on the list every pack deletes.
       Publish-Update.ps1's scan, diff, collection filter and that list,
       lifted by text the way test-ship-rules.ps1 does, name it in delete.txt
       whether or not the last pack carried it, and leave a copy still on the
       shipping machine out of the pack.
    4. The launcher side, compiled. OwnGame's Skip and Foreign, and Keep's
       Seed and Forget, are lifted by text out of the launcher source and
       compiled against stubs for Paths and Checks. Then the whole sequence
       runs on scratch folders: a Steam copy holding the old dresser, a game
       folder and a kept copy holding the stub, the pack's delete.txt with
       Keep.Forget, a refresh modelled on OwnGame.Refresh's own loop, and
       Keep.Seed. At the end the dresser must be in neither the game folder
       nor the kept copies. A thornswood- plugin the game folder is missing
       must still come back and be kept, so the model is not testing nothing.
    5. On this machine, where it can: the Steam copy's file, which baselines
       carry it, and what the launcher's record says, read the right way.

  Read only, apart from scratch folders under TEMP that it removes.
