  test-459-publish-record.ps1

  A full server publish records what the box now runs, and a put-back records
  what came back (#459, #2303).

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Publish-Server.ps1 put a new server on the box and wrote no
  record of it. Measured 30 Sep on dev: with 32dea10d installed, the box's
  data\thornswood-deploy.json still named the gamemode artifact e445101a,
  because the installer carried that file from the old folder into the new
  one as if it were runtime data. On 1 Oct a fresh build installed with no
  thornswood-build.json at all. And only Deploy-Server.ps1 wrote the site's
  deployed-build.json, so on 11 Oct, with the engine on dev through
  Publish-Server, the file held live alone and the credits page kept a hand
  sentence naming the engine the main server had left.

  HOW. Each part is run, not read, where it can be, against scratch folders:
    1. Set-ThornswoodServerRecord (Artifact.ps1): its text for the box runs
       under Windows PowerShell 5.1 when this machine has it, the box's
       PowerShell, with Invoke-ThornswoodArtifactRemote stood in. A root
       whose gamemode.js and stamp are the artifact's is recorded, beside it
       and in the store, with a history line; a wrong gamemode.js, a missing
       or wrong stamp, no gamemode.js, or an artifact with no gamemode each
       record nothing and say why.
    2. Restore-ThornswoodServerRecord, after a put-back: a folder whose record
       the store's artifact confirms becomes current; a folder carrying a
       record that does not describe its gamemode.js, and one with none, are
       recorded as older copies with no commit; a store that is not there yet
       is made.
    3. The installer's Carry, lifted from Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 and run:
       runtime data crosses, the deploy record stays with its folder, both
       ways.
    4. Export-ServerPayload.ps1 -Stamp, run on a scratch build: the payload's
       thornswood-build.json is the stamp it was given, and the build's own is
       left alone.
    5. Publish-Server.ps1, read: the artifact after the committed check, the
       gamemode from it, the stamp for the channel beside it, the payload held
       to both before anything is sent, and the records only once the
       installer has said INSTALL OK, a record not written stopping the run.

  Offline. Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7. Every temp folder is removed.
