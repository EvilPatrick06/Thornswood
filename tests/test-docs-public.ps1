# test-docs-public.ps1
#
# Deploy-Docs.ps1 sends a public file only when it differs from the copy on
# the VPS. On 25 September -Site and -Docs known both stopped with
# "scp.exe: dest open C:/Thornswood-Docs/public/banner.mp4: Failure", a file
# that had not changed since #91, and the throw left the public pages and the
# restart undone. Every file had gone up every time.
#
# This lifts the real lines out of Deploy-Docs, from the hash listing to the
# count it prints, and runs them with Remote standing in for ssh (the script
# it would send runs in Windows PowerShell 5.1 when this machine has it, the
# shell the VPS runs it in, and in this shell otherwise) and Push standing in
# for scp (a copy into a scratch folder that refuses the file marked as held).
# It touches nothing outside that scratch folder.
#
#   pwsh -File tests\test-docs-public.ps1                 the repo's copy
#   pwsh -File tests\test-docs-public.ps1 -Path <file>    any other copy
