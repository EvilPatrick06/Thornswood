  test-2705-hair-dye-help.js

  The Help page (site/data/help.md, thornswood.net/help) says how to dye your
  hair in the world, in the words a player sees, and nothing more (#2705).

  WHY THIS EXISTS. #2675 built hair dye (held draft #2699): a dye steeps at a
  cooking spot the way water boils, and only a Tailor (either half,
  Haberdasher or Liverywright, from novice) may steep one (Patrick, 18 Oct
  2026, #2699 at 2567ddae); anybody else is told whose work it is and nothing
  is taken. Using a dye is anybody's: your own hair is dyed from the Hair dye
  page of K, and somebody else's through an offer, from that page with them
  under the crosshair or from Dye hair under Near you on P, that they Accept.
  The how-to is a player page, so it describes presses and in-world actions
  only: no slash command, no issue number and no code. The colours, what
  makes them, how long a steep takes and whether there is a wash are the
  staff's list (game/data/hair-dyes.json), so the page names none of them and
  this fails if a staff setting turns up in it.

  Once the hair dye panels are in the repository, the button names the page
  uses have to be the ones the panels show, so a rename on either side fails
  here. Once the hair dye block is, the tailor gate has to be there, and the
  refusal line the page quotes has to be the one the block builds from the
  staff list's who, so a change to who may steep fails here until the page
  follows. Before then, those halves say SKIP.

  Read only.
