      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-discord-announced-shared.ps1

  Publish-Discord.ps1 keeps what it announced in the channel's VPS store
  (announced.json beside the feed, through Feed-Store.ps1), not in the
  checkout that posted (#2167). Two scratch checkouts share one stand-in
  store ($env:THORNSWOOD_TEST_SITE_DIR, so nothing connects to the VPS) and a
  stand-in webhook on 127.0.0.1 (so nothing reaches Discord):
    - a post from checkout A lands in the store, and a dry run from checkout
      B then says "already announced";
    - -Record from one checkout is seen by the other;
    - a new release is not taken for an old one, and -Force still posts;
    - an old bot\announced.json is still read while the store has none;
    - a store that cannot be read posts nothing;
    - a -Record whose send fails says so, exits 1 and records nothing;
    - a record that will not parse, or a store that cannot be read, posts
      nothing, and -Record over either exits 1.
