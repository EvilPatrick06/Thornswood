      powershell -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-watch-outside.ps1

  scripts\vps\Watch-Outside.ps1 runs on GitHub's Linux runners, from a public
  repository, outside the VPS (#2755), and tells staff in Discord when the
  site, a feed, the certificate, the address, the registration, the build
  runners or the Nexus collection breaks, once, and once more when it is
  fixed (issue #448).

  These drive the real script, dot-sourced, with the functions that touch the
  internet or the clock (Get-Http, Get-Cert, Get-Dns, Get-Runners,
  Send-Webhook, Get-Now) replaced by a table of fake answers. Nothing leaves
  the machine and nothing is posted. The cases: everything fine, a
  certificate near its end and then renewed, the site down and back, the
  runners offline and back, GitHub not answering about the runners (#2857:
  could not check, never "down"), a registry that does not answer, the
  address moved, a feed that is not a feed, a webhook that fails and then
  works, no webhook at all, this machine offline, what -Export writes for the
  public repository, and that the run log, which is public there, names
  nothing private.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
