      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-2975-server-port-once.ps1

  Publish-Server.ps1 and Deploy-Server.ps1 try the resources port from
  outside once, through Vps.ps1's Test-ThornswoodFromOutside, say what it
  answered, and do not call the port shut from a machine that reaches no raw
  port on the box.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #2975: after the box had already had the new server
  answer on both its ports (INSTALL OK, SWAP OK), Publish-Server tried the
  resources port up to 30 times two seconds apart, and Deploy-Server, which
  copied its shape, up to 10. That waited for nothing. Measured on the box on
  21 Oct 2026: 3000 and 7788 each listen on :: with one node process, the
  socket the box's own check finds, and their inbound allow rules are
  standing ones with remote Any, made when the box was set up. And from a
  cloud thread, whose container reaches nothing but HTTPS, every raw port is
  silent, so the loop always ended in "nothing is answering".

  HOW. Vps.ps1 is dot-sourced, and its two functions are run against a
  listener and closed ports on this machine's loopback. Both scripts reach
  the VPS the moment they run, so they are parsed and never run: the lines
  that decide what to say are lifted as text and run with the outside try
  stood in, once for each answer it can give, and what they print and
  whether they stop the run are held to what each case means.

  Never connects to anything off this machine.
