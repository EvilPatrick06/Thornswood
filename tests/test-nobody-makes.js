// Patrick, 23 September: "Remove all of the house pars except for a key", and
// asked which parts he meant, "I mean the craftable stuff in the forge hinges,
// locks, nails, iron fittings, etc". Separately, about the same menu: "Locks
// shouldn't be craftable". And, about the same bucket those four were sitting
// in: "Same with fishing poles which should be woodworkers".
//
// Both halves of that are one rule. Nine MISC rows come off the forge on this
// build and every one of them was open to everybody, because the rule that
// sorted them called itself stock and tools and its own comment named "nails,
// fishing poles" as the examples. Four of them are house parts nobody should
// make and four are the Woodwright's.
//
// Read only.

  Patrick: "Remove all of the house pars except for a key". When this file was
  first written there was no craftable key anywhere in the order, so this check
  said so. He then said plainly that there should be: "Smith's are supposed to
  be able to make a key", and "make a fucking mold item craftable dude this
  would solve alot". Both records are in the plugin now, so the check says the
  opposite thing for the same reason: the parts go, the key stays.
