  test-voice-ticket.ps1

  The Discord ticket only goes to the voice service over https.

  WHY (To Do 144). The ticket is a thirty day credential, as good as the
  person's Discord account to the site, and the launcher keeps it under DPAPI
  on disk. Voice.FetchToken posts it to the voice service's /token route to
  get a join token, at conf.VoiceBase(). VoiceBase gives the feed's VoiceUrl
  when there is one, which is https://thornswood.net/voice on this machine
  and /voice-dev on the dev build, and falls back to http://address:7778 when
  VoiceUrl is empty. It is empty on a new install until the first update check
  fills it in, and the feed can empty it on purpose, which is the rollback
  path in Publish-Update.ps1 and Shell.cs. Every one of those posted the
  ticket in the clear. Nothing else in the launcher sends the ticket anywhere
  but Discord.Site, which is https.

  This lifts FetchToken and JsonEscape out of the shipped Voice.cs by name and
  brace match, the same way test-dev-version.ps1 lifts the version block out
  of Ship.ps1, compiles them against a stub Discord and Config with the
  compiler the build runs (Add-LauncherType, tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1, #2821;
  off Windows it says SKIP, that compiler is only there), and points
  them at a socket on loopback that records every byte it is sent. So the
  question "did the ticket cross the wire" is answered by the wire.

  Read only. It opens sockets on 127.0.0.1 and nothing else.
