// test-watchdog.js
//
// The check that tells somebody the server is gone must not be able to switch
// itself off.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. thornswood-front.js asks the server for online.json every ten
// seconds and quits to the main menu after twelve unanswered asks in a row. A
// flag says an ask is out, and checkServer does nothing while it is set. That
// flag was cleared only by the ask's own answer, so one request that never came
// back left the watchdog off for the rest of the session.
//
// MEASURED IN THE FORK. skyrim-platform/src/platform_lib/HttpClient.cpp builds
// an httplib::Client with no timeouts, on one pool of three threads shared by
// every plugin, and the vendored cpp-httplib 0.40.0 defaults the connect and
// read timeouts to 300 seconds. So a server that accepts the connection and
// never answers held each ask for five minutes: twelve strikes in about an hour
// instead of two minutes. And a request that throws on its worker thread never
// calls back at all, because BS_thread_pool keeps the error in a future that
// HttpClient.cpp drops, so the flag stayed set for good.
//
// This cuts the real watchdog out of the plugin and runs it against a server
// that never answers, one that answers late, and one that refuses at once, on a
// clock the test controls.
//
// Read only.
