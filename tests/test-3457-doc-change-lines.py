Issue #3457: #3445 rewrote the join and rules pages, which #start-here,
#welcome, #faq and #game-rules are read out of, and added no change line for
them in bot/content.py. Its build was green, because the one check that a doc
has its line (Build-Discord.py, check_docs) ran only in the bot's harnesses,
and those need discord.py and run only at night. So main went red there and
the next Discord build would have refused to run.

The fingerprints live in content.py now (doc_print, unrecorded), which needs
nothing but the standard library, so this runs on every pull request and a
change to a doc's words without its line goes red on the change itself. The
nightly still runs check_docs over the build's own list of written channels
(bot/test-3317-layout.py, bot/test-3336-changelogs.py). It proves:
  - every doc that is not a draft has its change line today;
  - with the newest line of one doc taken off, unrecorded names that doc
    and the fingerprint its words have;
  - with a doc's words changed, unrecorded names it;
  - a doc with no changelog at all is named, and a draft never is;
  - check_docs asks content.py, and Build-Discord.py keeps no fingerprint of
    its own to drift from it.
Read only. Never connects to anything.
