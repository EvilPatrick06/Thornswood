// #2483: a kept NPC stood twice for a moment. Each game spawned the server's
// copy with placeAtMe and left the plugin's placed copy standing until the
// world cleaner picked it at random. The fix is in the fork
// (engine/skymp/skymp5-client/src/view/formView.ts): the view takes the placed
// reference (refrId - 0x100000000) instead of spawning a second one.
//
// This runs the fork's own harness, skymp5-client/test-kept-npc-adopt.js,
// against the pinned engine/skymp. It needs the submodule checked out
// (git submodule update --init engine/skymp). Without it this says SKIP,
// which is the pull request gate and the nightly's harness shares; the
// nightly's fork step fetches it and runs this with THORNSWOOD_FORK_REQUIRED.
