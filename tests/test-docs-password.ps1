  test-docs-password.ps1

  Deploy-Docs.ps1 -Password changes the site's password and nothing else in
  its config.json.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. -Password used to write {"password": ...} over the whole of
  config.json on the VPS. That file also holds the Discord client id and
  secret, the bot token, the bot key, the admins, the server password and the
  cookie secret, and all of them went. It is worse than an inconvenience:
  discordReady() in server.js is clientId and clientSecret both set, isMember
  and /api/login only take the password while it is false, so a wiped config
  turned the password door back on. Getting the rest back meant re-running
  Install-Bot and Set-DiscordLogin. It is "Deploy-Docs -Password wipes the
  whole site config" on the To Do List.

  HOW. The body of the -Password branch is lifted out of Deploy-Docs.ps1 by
  the parser, not copied here, so this tests what ships. Remote is swapped for
  one that runs the same encoded command in Windows PowerShell 5.1 on this
  machine instead of on the VPS over ssh. 5.1 on purpose: it is what the VPS
  runs, and its ConvertFrom-Json and ConvertTo-Json decide what gets written.
  Then node reads the result the way server.js does, with JSON.parse, and
  without stripping a byte order mark first, so a mark is a failure here.

  Read only apart from its own temp folder. Never connects to anything.
