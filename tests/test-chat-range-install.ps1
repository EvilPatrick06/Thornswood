  test-chat-range-install.ps1

  Install-Voice.ps1 installs local chat on unless told otherwise, and keeps
  whatever range is running.

  Entry 150 put local in-character chat into the voice service behind
  THORNSWOOD_CHAT_RANGE (voice\test-local-chat.js drives the service
  itself). It shipped off until 4 Oct, when Patrick said local chat "should
  have went out with the other changes to live", and Install-Voice.ps1's
  default became on. A setting only counts if the install hands it over, and
  the install builds the service's command line inside a here-string that is
  expanded on this machine and run on the VPS. That expansion is where '$log'
  once became '**' and killed live voice twice (Check-VoiceInstall.ps1), so
  this expands it the same way and reads the line that starts the service.

  It also checks the other direction. An install run later for some other
  reason, with no -ChatRange on it, must keep whatever range is running, the
  same as -Bind and -Auth already do, off included. Otherwise the next voice
  fix quietly turns local chat back into global chat, and nobody notices until
  a scene on the Whiterun road is read in Markarth again, or turns a range
  somebody switched off on purpose back on.

  Read only. Never connects to anything.
