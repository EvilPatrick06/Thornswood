// A seam holds twenty, gives one a swing, and comes back on a clock.
//
// Patrick, 21 September, after playing it: "make each quarry have up to 20 ore
// and not skip the animation ... you get an ore each time you hit it you know
// not all at omce so you can stay for a little and get a little or stay andd
// get all 20", with ten minutes for iron, gold, corundum and silver and thirty
// for moonstone, quicksilver, orichalcum, ebony and malachite. Issue #1380 put
// the miner page's own clock in their place: iron fifteen, gold twenty,
// corundum and silver ten, the rest thirty. Ebony is a scarce place now.
//
// WHAT IT REPLACED: one press handed over the whole yield and then refused
// everybody for between ten minutes and four hours. A seam was a vending
// machine with a long queue. And every branch of the activate chain ends at
// `return false`, which blocks the engine's own handover, so the mining
// animation was thrown away by our own code.

    ============================== ONE ANIMATION, AND A WAY OUT OF IT =========

    Patrick, 22 September: "the mining animation doesnt always use your pick
    and tehre are two ... it stops making the noise as its supposed you dont
    get the ore as it hits the vein ... you get stuck in the animation no way
    out even when tping, a fresh game load, trying to walk away, trying to
    escape menu anyuthing its trapped in that state".

    THIS HARNESS PASSED THROUGH ALL OF THAT, and the line it passed on is the
    first one below as it used to read: 'mining answers ALLOW so the press is
    not blocked', matched with /return ALLOW;/ against the whole file. mineOre
    stopped answering ALLOW and the test went on passing, because chopWood
    still does and the pattern was never anchored to mining. A check that
    cannot fail is not a check. Every one below names the function it is about
    and cuts the file down to it first.

    WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG is written out at SWING_PROPERTY in the gamemode:
    updateOwner scripts run every frame in skymp5-client, not on change, so a
    stored swing replayed sixty times a second forever and survived a fresh
    game load because nothing cleared it.
