      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-get-logs.ps1
      powershell -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-get-logs.ps1

  Get-Logs.ps1, issue #453 leftover: the rolled generations of every log
  that rolls come down with the current file. door.log does not roll, so it
  stays current-only.

  And the pull itself (#1605). On 4 Oct every pull under PowerShell 7.6.6
  printed a MetadataError for every log, said "1 lines" for each, and wrote a
  rolled generation the box does not have as a file holding the MISSING line.
  Two causes. The script kept what ssh answered in $lines, which is the
  [int]$Lines parameter, because PowerShell names ignore case. And it made up
  the names: .1 through .5 of every log that rolls, each asked for whether
  the box had it or not, 15 of 31 asks on that pull answered MISSING. It now
  asks the box once which files it has and reads exactly those.

  So this runs the real script against a stand-in ssh that runs each
  question's PowerShell, the way the box would, against a stand-in box in a
  temp folder, and looks at what it asks, what it says and what it leaves in
  the folder.

  No ssh and no VPS.
