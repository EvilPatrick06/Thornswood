  test-deploy-server-online.ps1

  Deploy-Server.ps1 treats a server with nothing listening as nobody online,
  and removes a leftover restart.json when it stops. Issue #524: the live
  half of the same two gaps Deploy-DevGamemode closed. Issue #520 keeps the
  same OnlineNow listen check and puts the warn/refuse path beside it.

  HOW. The live warning block (Read-LiveOnline / Get-LiveOnline / OnlineNow)
  is taken out of the deploy and driven with Remote replaced by a local run
  against a temp folder, with a real UDP socket on loopback standing in for
  the server, and with none. StopOurs is taken out of the swap block and run
  against the same temp folder, with everything in it that stops a task or
  a process replaced by a stand-in.

  Never connects to the VPS.
