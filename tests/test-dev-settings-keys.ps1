  test-dev-settings-keys.ps1

  Deploy-DevGamemode never swaps in a copy of the dev settings that went stale
  while it counted down.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #1224. Deploy-DevGamemode copies the dev server's
  server-settings.json into its stage, edits the copy there, warns whoever is
  on, waits out the countdown, and swaps the copy in. Anything that changed
  the running settings in that minute (a second run, Publish-Server -Channel
  dev, a hand edit) was overwritten by the older copy, and nothing said so.
  Deploy-Server had the same hole and #1222 closed it with a read-back in
  Swap.ps1: given the keys a release means to change ($ReleaseKeys), the swap
  compares every other key of the file it is about to start with the one the
  server had, and puts the old files back when one moved.

  So this checks two things:

    1. Deploy-DevGamemode's $DevSettingsKeys is exactly the set of keys its
       edit block writes, read out of the script, so a new edit cannot leave
       the read-back calling its own change drift, and a stale entry cannot
       let a key nobody edits through unread. And the swap is handed that list
       on a deploy and nothing on a -PutBack.
    2. Swap.ps1's real read-back, lifted out of $swapBlock and run over two
       folders here with that list: the keys the deploy edits pass, and a key
       changed on the running file between the stage and the swap stops the
       swap and is named.

  Read only, apart from two folders under the temp directory.
