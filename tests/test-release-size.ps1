  test-release-size.ps1

  A release the size of the mod collection is refused before anything is zipped.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. 17 September: an uninstall test removed Profile from the
  machine that ships, Profile\OwnGame\files.txt went with it, and the next
  release got as far as "29,063 added or changed (11,368.1 MB)" before it was
  stopped by hand. Nothing in the publisher looked at the total. Entry 197 on the To
  Do List: "A size gate on the release, a dozen lines, so an 11.3 GB near-miss
  cannot happen again."

  This lifts the block between the release size markers out of
  Publish-Update.ps1 and feeds it the incident's own number, the way
  test-publish-resume.ps1 lifts the resume block, then reads where the gate is
  called from. The rest of that script uploads and pushes a feed, so
  it is not run here; test-publish-refusals.ps1 runs it whole against a temp
  install with a small cap.

  Read only. Never connects to anything.
