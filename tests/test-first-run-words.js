// The launcher tells a new person to give their character a Skyrim name, and
// never tells them to save before connecting.
//
// From the To Do List, entry 163: "The Play page tells a new person to name the
// character after themselves, and to save before connecting." The first-run
// card on the Play page said "Create a character and name it after yourself"
// and "Save once before connecting. Joining from an unsaved game drops you back
// to the menu." Both were the old multiplayer mod's advice, carried over. The name is
// what everybody sees above your head, so somebody who followed the card walked
// into Whiterun under their own name. And there is no saving here: the site's
// help page says "No saving. The server holds your character. Quitting is
// safe."
//
// The same name advice was in the Help page's first Joining item, two pages
// away, and its third item still explained saving by what the old
// multiplayer mod used to refuse. Fixing the card alone would have left the launcher telling
// two different stories, so this reads both and checks they agree. The
// launcher's Help page went with #3146 (help before the game is the site's,
// in the game it is F7), so the other half is the site's help now.
//
