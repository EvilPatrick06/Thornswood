  test-ship-rules.ps1

  Every file that has ever leaked in a pack or an installer stays out, and the
  rules that decide what leaves this machine still say what they mean.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Ship-Rules.ps1 is the one list of what never leaves a
  machine, and nearly every line in it is there because something already got
  out: the SkyMP sign in token inside the installer, one machine's
  Thornswood.ini with Fov=120 in the three packs of 16 and 17 September,
  a 6 MB vortex.deployment.json in pack-20260916-1217, the voice join token in
  nine packs from 18 to 20 September, a report and a script from the Claude
  desktop app in packs 20260916-0130 to 0937, and the front's own 147 fonts
  and sounds wrongly left out by the dev Ship of 20 September at 13:02. Entry
  197 on the To Do List: "Ship-Rules is the highest-yield unit test in the
  repo, seven incidents have already happened inside it".

  So each incident case below is the exact relative path its own comment in
  Ship-Rules.ps1 names, asked of the real functions, dot-sourced. A rule that
  is edited away, or a rewrite that turns one list into another, turns a line
  here red before a pack carries the file again.

  MARKETPLACETEXTURES.BSA. Bethesda's archive for the in-game Creations menu,
  2.8 MB, which every pack and the installer carried because it was in
  neither vanilla list and Vortex does not provide it. Both pack baselines on
  Patrick's machine list it, so the fix has to leave it out WITHOUT the next
  pack listing it as removed, or every launcher deletes a Bethesda file off
  every tester. This drives the diff and the removal filter lifted by text out
  of the shipped Publish-Update.ps1, the same way test-master-flag.ps1 lifts
  its functions out of Deploy-Gamemode.ps1, so it tests the real code.

  THE LOOSE ART REPORT. Get-ShipLooseArt names, a folder at a time, the loose
  textures and meshes an installer is about to carry that are neither ours nor
  the collection's. On 22 September that was 547 MB nobody had accounted for.

  Where this machine has a pack baseline and a Profile\OwnGame\files.txt, it
  measures against them too, and says SKIP where it cannot.

  -RulesPath runs it against another copy of Ship-Rules.ps1, so a scratch copy
  with a rule taken out can be shown to turn it red.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder.
