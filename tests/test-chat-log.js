  test-chat-log.js

  What people said, written down, so a report about behaviour can be answered
  by reading it rather than by asking both of them and believing whichever is
  more convincing.

  The parts worth a test are the ones that are quietly wrong while the feature
  still looks like it works:

    APPEND ONLY, ONE LINE A MESSAGE. A log that gets rewritten is not evidence.
    An append is also the only shape that survives the process being killed
    mid-write, and the reader has to cope with the truncated last line that
    leaves rather than throwing away the other four thousand.

    THE PROFILE ID COMES OFF THE TOKEN. onJoin decides who somebody is from the
    signed token and records whether that was proven. Every line carries that
    flag, because a line from an unproven join is worth keeping and is not
    worth hanging anybody on.

    A DAY IS LOCAL TIME. Every other stamp on that box is local, and an
    evening's argument that straddles midnight UTC should not straddle two
    files.

  This lifts the real functions out of voice-server.js by text, so a rename
  fails loudly rather than testing a copy. Read only apart from its own temp
  folder.
