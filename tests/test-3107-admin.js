// #3107 (Patrick's A of 22 Oct 2026): the box's GitHub admin service.
//
// A cloud Claude thread cannot change a runner's labels (its proxy refuses
// every actions/runners path) and a workflow's own token cannot either, so a
// GitHub App made for Thornswood holds that right, its key kept on the box by
// scripts/vps/admin/admin.js, which listens only to a run of the private
// ops repository's .github/workflows/github-admin.yml on its main and only
// makes the runners registered there match this repository's main runner
// records (#4013). This runs it for real on loopback:
//   1. the OIDC check, against tokens signed here with a key a stand-in for
//      GitHub's published keys serves: a hand-started run of the ops
//      repository's github-admin.yml on main passes; a push's run, a token
//      from another workflow, another branch, a pull request, another
//      repository (this one included), another
//      audience or issuer, an expired one, one signed by a key GitHub does
//      not publish, one whose body was changed after signing, and one that
//      says it needs no signature, each fail;
//   2. the App's own token: RS256, signed by the App's key, issued by its id,
//      ten minutes at most;
//   3. the records' rules and the plan for one record, the cases #2994's
//      test held Set-BuildRunners.ps1 to: a listed runner without the label
//      gets it, a VPS runner or an off-box runner the record does not list
//      loses it, a right one is left alone, a listed runner GitHub does not
//      have is named, and a record whose runners GitHub has none of, one
//      that names a label every runner carries, lists no runners, or names a
//      label another record names, stops; and a label of our own that no
//      record names comes off every runner (#4033), while the labels GitHub
//      gives (read-only) and the reserved ones stay;
//   3b. the About record (#3682): the real records/repo-about.json passes, and
//      an empty, too long or two-line description, a website that is not
//      https, and a topic in capitals, twice, or past GitHub's 20 each stop;
//      topics compare in any order;
//   4. admin.js spawned against a stand-in GitHub: anything through Caddy
//      (X-Forwarded-For) but the setup pages is the plain 404; no token, a
//      branch's token, and a token for another audience are 403 with nothing
//      asked of GitHub; with no App it says how to make one; with one, a
//      check says what differs and changes nothing, a run puts the labels
//      right on the ops repository with an installation token for it alone,
//      reads them back, and a second run changes nothing; runner 3's
//      thornswood-sign, whose record is gone (#4033), comes off; the records come
//      from this repository's main through the App, with a read-only token
//      for this repository alone, never from the caller; installation-repos
//      (#4013) lists the repositories the App is on with a token that reads
//      metadata alone, and changes nothing; settings (#3534) only reads this
//      repository's, with a read-only token for it alone that asks for the
//      secret, variable and environment names only when the App holds them,
//      says which it could not read and why, and never hands back a value;
//      and the log holds no token. The About box the same way, with a token
//      for this repository alone: a check names what differs and writes
//      nothing, a run sets it in one PATCH and one PUT and reads it back, a
//      second run changes nothing, and a bad record on main stops it;
//   4a. repository settings (#3683): the record's rules (Thornswood and the
//      engine fork only, each once; reporting true or false when given; per
//      ruleset a name, branch or tag, active or disabled, a ref, rules with
//      types, a bypass list, no name twice), what GitHub's copy must say
//      (every key the record gives, lists in any order, GitHub's own ids and
//      defaults ignored), and the service: a check says what would be made
//      or switched and changes nothing; a run makes the missing rulesets in
//      each repository with a token for that repository alone, puts a
//      changed one back by name, sending only the ruleset's own keys,
//      switches the fork's private reporting as the record says and leaves
//      it alone where the record says nothing, switches secret scanning and
//      push protection in one PATCH of only the keys that differ (push
//      protection only with scanning, each true or false), switches
//      immutable releases with PUT or DELETE as the record says, reads everything
//      back, and a
//      second run changes nothing; a ruleset the record does not name stops
//      it and is never deleted; a repository the App is not installed on
//      stops for it with the link to the installation's settings while the
//      other is still matched; an entry's collaborators list takes off
//      whoever it does not name (never the owner), withdraws an unnamed
//      invitation, only reports who it names that is missing and never
//      invites anybody (no PUT), reads back, and changes nothing a second
//      time, and an entry with no list never touches its people;
//      and the real records/github-repo-settings.json, when there is one,
//      passes;
//   5. the App's setup: no armed setup, a wrong or expired state, and an App
//      already held are the plain 404; the armed page sends the manifest
//      (administration write, contents read, no webhook, private) to GitHub
//      with the state; GitHub's code comes back to /setup/done, the key
//      lands in the state folder, the setup is disarmed, and the key is in
//      neither the page nor the log; an App another account made is refused
//      and nothing is kept.
//
// Nothing leaves loopback, and nothing outside the temp folder is touched.
