// test-server-down.js
//
// When the server goes away, the person is told on screen, with a countdown,
// before they are put back at the main menu.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. Entry 159 on the To Do List: "When the server restarts you
// are thrown to the main menu with no message at all." It asks for
// "Connection to the server was lost, returning to the main menu, on screen,
// with the countdown. Every online game does this." The sentence existed, but
// it went through say(), which is log only, and the five seconds before the
// quit were a bare delay with nothing drawn.
//
// THE TRAP IN THE OBVIOUS FIX. The outage is noticed in onStrike, and onStrike
// runs inside the probe's HttpClient callback. SkyrimPlatform delivers those
// from its tick (TickImpl in SkyrimPlatform.cpp in the fork), and there is no
// Papyrus VM on tick, so CallNativeApi.cpp throws "can't be called in this
// context" for Debug.notification. note() swallows that throw. So turning the
// say() in onStrike into a note() would have looked right, passed a parse, and
// still put nothing on anybody's screen.
//
// A probe that never answers is the other way the outage is noticed: once it
// is past PROBE_DEADLINE_MS, checkServer counts it from the update tick. S7
// holds that path to the same message and countdown.
//
// So this runs the real code, lifted out of thornswood-front.js, against a
// SkyrimPlatform that refuses game calls outside update exactly the way the
// fork does, and looks at what reached the corner of the screen.
//
// Read only.
