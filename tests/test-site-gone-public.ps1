  test-site-gone-public.ps1

      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-site-gone-public.ps1

  A public file that leaves the repository leaves the site. On 17 Oct
  thornswood.net still served looks.js and looks.css after #2572 took the
  "Make the site yours" panel out, because Deploy-Docs sends only the public
  files that changed and nothing ever took one away.

  What this proves, with no box and no network:
    1. Deploy-Docs.ps1 names the public files the box has and the repository
       does not, counts them as a change to the app, and hands them to the
       swap as $Gone.
    2. Swap.ps1's service swap block, run for real on a scratch root under
       Windows PowerShell: a healthy start takes the gone file out into the
       .prev folder and says so, and a start that does not answer puts it
       back with the old files.

  Everything it writes is in its own temp folder.
