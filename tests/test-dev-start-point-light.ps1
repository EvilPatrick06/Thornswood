  test-dev-start-point-light.ps1

  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 puts the start point's file index at Skyrim
  Unbound.esp's place among the FULL plugins, not its place in the list
  (#2011).

  WHY. With an engine that loads light plugins (#1715) the dev loadOrder holds
  48 full and 54 light plugins, and a form id's top byte counts full plugins
  only. The block counted the list, so the dev deploy of 5 Oct 10:01 PM moved
  the start point to 0x5E19BAD4 (Unbound 94th in the list, 45th among full
  plugins), and at 11:00 PM a new character died at login with
    Error: FromFormId failed due to invalid file index 94 (5e19bad4)

  HOW. The same as test-dev-deploy-pass.ps1: the settings block is lifted out
  of the script, expanded here with the values the script would have (its
  counting function and light rule from ServerOrder.ps1, and whether the record says the engine loads light plugins),
  over plugin files written here with the TES4 header flags each case names,
  since the block reads them where the dev server loads them (#2947),
  and run in Windows PowerShell, what sshd runs on the box, against a
  server-settings.json in a temp folder. Nothing connects to anything.

  The last case is the measured one, and runs where this machine has the build
  the dev server runs (THORNSWOOD_DEV_SETTINGS names its server-settings.json;
  the fork build it named by default, claude-1005-skymp, no longer exists)
  and the game folder whose headers say which plugins are light
  (C:\Thornswood\Game\Data);
  elsewhere it says SKIP.
