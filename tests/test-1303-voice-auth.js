// #1303, #1315, #1337, #1322. Who the voice service lets in, and how a join
// token is carried, on every pull request.
//
// The voice harnesses beside the service (voice\test-*.js) run every night,
// not in Launcher builds. A change that let an unproven connection back in,
// minted a join token without the site's yes, answered a handshake that
// carried no token, or let one token open two connections would let a
// stranger into every conversation and onto the roster, and would sit on
// main until the next night. So this runs voice\test-auth.js, which starts
// the real voice-server.js beside a small site of its own and drives /token
// and the handshake, and voice\test-token-refresh.js, which runs the game's
// chat overlay and checks it spends a token on one try only. It fails with
// either. Nothing is copied out of them, so they cannot drift apart.
//
// Writes only to temp folders, through voice\test-auth.js.
