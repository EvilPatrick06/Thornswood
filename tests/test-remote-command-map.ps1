      powershell -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-remote-command-map.ps1

  Every call under scripts\ that reaches the VPS is in
  records\remote-commands.json, with what it does and the class it needs: a
  gate verb (stage, swap, putback, feed-send, task-start-stop, read-status),
  admin, or transport (a helper that only carries what its caller hands it,
  where the caller is the row that counts). Issue #2182, section 5 step 1 of
  docs\DEPLOY-IDENTITIES.md.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Section 2 of that doc was first read off script names, not
  off the commands each script sends. A deploy identity built from a list like
  that either breaks (a deploy path sends something only admin may do) or is
  given more than any script uses. The record is the checked list, and this
  keeps it true: a new remote call with no row fails here, and so does a row
  whose call is gone.

  HOW. Parses every .ps1 and .psm1 under scripts\ with the PowerShell parser
  (tests\fixtures\remote-calls.ps1; comments and the text of scripts sent to
  the box are not commands, so they never count) and finds each command named
  ssh, scp, ssh-keyscan, Invoke-ThornswoodRemote,
  Invoke-ThornswoodSecretRemote, Invoke-ThornswoodArtifactRemote,
  Send-ThornswoodArtifactFile or Remote, and each call of Remote.ps1 by path.

  A ROW NAMES ITS CALL BY TEXT, NOT BY PLACE (#2498). A row is script, the
  function the call sits in (<top> outside one), the command, and an anchor:
  text from the call's own lines, or from the few lines above it when several
  calls in that function send the same text. Until #2498 a row carried the
  call's number among its script's calls instead, so a call put in ahead of
  others moved every later row onto the wrong call (#2471, #2500) and only a
  renumbering by hand, which nothing checked, put them back. Now an anchor
  that names no call, or more than one, fails here, and so does a call that
  no row names or that two rows name. A call put in anywhere fails by name
  until it has a row, and every other row stays on its own call. Nothing is
  run and nothing leaves this machine.
