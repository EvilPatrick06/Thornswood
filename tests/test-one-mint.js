// test-one-mint.js
//
// Authorized coin sources are explicit and bounded. A character gets forty
// once; dungeon rewards use fixed tier ranges and durable return reservations.
// Merchant NPC starting purses are checked by test-npc-merchant-purses.js and
// test-merchant-ledger-storage.js; receipt-based trading conservation is checked
// by test-merchant-trading.js and test-merchant-settlement.js.
//
// Entry 326 on the To Do List is the economy with a bottom: traders who start
// with a purse and buy and sell against it, "so coin moves between people
// rather than appearing". The traders wait on a design Patrick and Djinn have
// not settled. The bottom is already built. Patrick, 21 September, as the
// spoils block in gamemode.js records it: "all weapons, armour, tools, and
// gold are not spawned in the world at all", and "everyone starts with 40
// gold, and we can add a job for gold later but that's just to start." So
// today the one mint is purse() in the spoils block: forty gold, once per
// character, with the mark on the character.
//
// An economy with a floor is only as good as that staying true, and nothing
// checked it. The entry's own check was Select-String for 'f:Skyrim\.esm'.
// Measured on 24 September, that pattern matches 1,099 descriptors on 228
// lines, frost salts (3ad5f:Skyrim.esm) among them, and not one of them is
// gold, because gold is not written as a descriptor anywhere in the file. So
// this reads the file properly instead:
//
//   1. purse() hands over forty once, and still says no after a restart. The
//      entry names the trap: a purse held in a Map "resets to full on every
//      server update, which is a money printer on a schedule".
//   2. Every write into a pack is in a function on the list below, with the
//      reason it cannot make a coin. A new one fails here until somebody has
//      read it and put it on the list.
//   3. No descriptor in the file names Gold001, so addItem, the shift, the
//      deed, the key, the mold and the testers' /give can never hand gold
//      over, and every addItem caller takes its descriptor out of a table.
//   4. A trade moves coin and never makes it: the total is the same after.
//   5. No recipe in the load order makes gold, and the gamemode never asks
//      Papyrus to AddItem.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE. A mod that hands out gold on somebody's own machine
// loses the gold, which known.md says for Tavern Games; that is the engine's
// business and not this file's. And a recipe added to the collection after
// game/data/recipes.json was last built is not in it until Build-RecipeTable.ps1
// runs again.
