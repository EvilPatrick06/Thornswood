  test-2061-watch-load-install.ps1

  Issue #2061: the load record was never put on the VPS. There was no
  Thornswood Load task and no load.csv, and nothing had said so. This proves,
  offline, that Watch-Load.ps1 now tells an install that took from one that
  did not, and that -Remove and the report still behave.

  Watch-Load.ps1 is copied into a scratch folder beside stand-ins for Vps.ps1
  and Send-Script.ps1. The stand-in Invoke-ThornswoodRemote records the script
  it was handed and returns canned lines, so nothing here connects to the VPS
  or makes a scheduled task. The scratch folder is removed at the end.
