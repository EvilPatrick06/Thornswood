  test-downgrade-copy-order.js

  The downgrade finishes safely and the installer sends a wrong build to it.
  This guards the three fixes from issue #369 that shipped without a harness of
  their own (commit 146b605, "Launcher: #369 F1/F2/F3/F4 downgrade path").

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Three small faults were found on the downgrade path and
  fixed but never covered by a test, so a later change could undo any of them
  in silence. This reads the source and checks the shape each fix relies on:

    F1  installer\Setup-Thornswood.ps1: a wrong Skyrim build is not a failed
        check. Counting it as a miss kept the window shut and never opened the
        launcher whose Downgrade button fixes it. So the build check counts it
        as next, and the notice above tells the person to press Downgrade in
        the launcher, not to pick a build from Steam's Betas list.

    F3  launcher\app\OwnGameShare.cs, TakePinned, which the Downgrade copies
        through since #1218: SkyrimSE.exe is held back and copied last,
        after every other file is in place. The build is read from that one
        file, so the moment it lands the copy reads as 1.6.1170. Copied first,
        a copy that then stops part way took the Downgrade card and its Try
        again button away with the job unfinished; copied last, a stop part way
        leaves the exe on the old build so the card and button stay.

    F4  launcher\app\Downgrade.cs: the twenty minute fallback takes a part as
        done only once the folder has reached the size Steam announced for it.
        A folder short of that is a stall, not a finish, and taking it as done
        writes the marker and copies truncated files over the Steam copy.

  The launcher cannot be started from here (CLAUDE.md forbids it), and this
  machine has no Windows csc, so like test-downgrade-asks.js this reads the
  source and checks the shape rather than running the button.

  Read only. It reads launcher\app\Downgrade.cs, launcher\app\OwnGameShare.cs
  and installer\Setup-Thornswood.ps1.
