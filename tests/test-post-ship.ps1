  What follows a published tip: Publish-PostShip.ps1, the one script Ship.ps1
  calls after the release is on the feed, and the two scripts it calls in turn,
  the website lane's scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1. VirusTotal is no
  longer part of publish (#802); Publish-VirusTotal.ps1 stays as a manual tool.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Ship ended at "Everyone in the world has five minutes" while
  two things it had never done were left to somebody remembering: the site feed
  a launcher polls held whatever was last copied there by hand, and the
  site feed a launcher polls still held whatever was last copied there by hand.

  WHAT IT WATCHES FOR, beyond that the wiring is there.

    - Publish-PostShip.ps1 implements neither half. It is checked for making the
      two calls the lanes pinned, by their own paths, so a later session cannot
      quietly grow a third copy of a remirror in here.
    - There is no launcher step after the tip. The Launcher lane answered on
      27 September that the tip customers get is version.json and launchers poll
      the feed url in it, so the remirror is how a launcher update reaches
      anybody, and Ship's mid-release Install-Launcher.ps1 refreshes the install
      on the machine that shipped. This fails if a launcher step is ever added
      after the publish, and it checks the mid-release ones are still there,
      before the publisher: the built launcher with the root and the build
      output, and the feed's launcher a kept-launcher -Package Ship puts in
      the root (#2661).
    - Ship runs the helper once, inside a block a dry run never
      reaches, so a dry run cannot touch the VPS or the site.
    - The remirror call sits after the publisher and before the site news, in the order
      the website lane pinned: the remirror, then the news, the
      Discord post and the server countdown, because those three tell people to
      update and the feed has to be serving the release before that.
    - Nothing after the tip can fail the release. A script another lane has not
      landed is a line, a remirror that refuses is a line, and Ship still exits
      0: "Exit 1 = refused publish (do not fail the release)".
    - A failure leaves the release published and makes Ship exit non-zero, which
      is the standing order that the follow-ons go out with the tip.
    - The helper reads each half's exit code, runs the second half even when the
      first stopped, says which line puts a failed half right, and treats a half
      that is not on the machine as a failure rather than a quiet pass.

  Read only apart from files under its own temp folder. Nothing here reaches the
  network: the halves it drives are stand-ins that write a line and hand back the
  code they are told to.
