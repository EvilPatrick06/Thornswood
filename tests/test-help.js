// test-help.js
//
// /help points at the help panel, and nothing advertises a command it will
// then refuse.
//
// From the To Do List: "/help is a developer's command list, and the
// unknown-command reply advertises a command everybody is then refused...
// /help opens a short menu: controls, how to talk, the rules, how to reach
// staff, what to do first. Filter it by permission, which /help two lines
// above already does correctly and the fallback simply forgot to."
//
// Since #1633 (Patrick, 4 October: no chat commands for anything people do)
// the menu and its six topics are the help panel, game/ui/thornswood-help.js,
// on its own key and on Help on the K, P and J panels; test-1633-help-panel.js
// holds the panel. What is left here is the half worth a harness from the
// start: /help, /commands and a word nobody has are answered with one line,
// helpLine, that says where the panel is and names the commands people still
// type, and a tester's own commands to a tester alone. A reply that names /tp
// to somebody who will be refused /tp is worse than saying nothing: it is the
// first thing a new person learns about this server and it is a no.
//
// Read only.
