  The Downgrade button reaches Steam even when Windows will not open a steam://
  link, says on the card why it stopped whenever it stops, and shows how far it
  has got.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Patrick, 24 September, a tester on 1.1.94: "the dowgrader
  this time didnt even upon the steam console let alone put the commands in for
  you", then that another server's downgrader "does this so it is possible", and
  "they have a progress bar of it in the launcher". Read from
  launcher\app\Downgrade.cs that evening:

    1. Every request to Steam was Process.Start("steam://...") inside catch { }.
       Where the link does not open, that threw, the throw was thrown away,
       Steam was never asked, and nothing was written anywhere.
    2. Every early stop (no Steam install found, Skyrim running, another
       Skyrim running, Steam not starting, a copy that failed) went to the
       launcher log alone. The line under the button kept its old words, so the
       button looked like it did nothing.
    3. With Steam in the tray and no window, the console was asked for once:
       the second request sat below the check for a window.
    4. The card said "7,145 MB down so far" with no end, and had no bar.

  WHAT WAS STILL MISSING, read again on 27 September, with the issue reopened
  as a real open bug that no released launcher had fixed:

    5. The bar only came up once bytes started landing. Opening Steam, signing
       in and getting the console to take the first command take minutes
       between them, so the longest wait in the run had nothing moving.
    6. The three downloads had the whole bar, so it filled to the end when the
       last part came down and then started again at nothing for the copy.
    7. Three stops did reach the card and then said "see the log": the
       deadline, Steam refusing a part, and a download that was not the build.
       The entry asks for why and what to do next, not a file to go and find.
    8. AskSteam reported false and nothing read it, so a machine that could
       not be made to open Steam at all waited ninety seconds first.

  HOW. The real text of AskSteam, Stop, Progress, SizedLine, Percent,
  DepotBytes, ProgressLine, ClipboardLine, Next and Parts is lifted out of
  Downgrade.cs by brace match and compiled with the compiler the build runs
  (tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1), beside a Process that records what it was asked to
  start instead of starting it, and a Steam install in a temp folder. Nothing
  opens Steam. The rest is read off Run's and TypeIntoConsole's text.

  Read only apart from its own temp folder.
