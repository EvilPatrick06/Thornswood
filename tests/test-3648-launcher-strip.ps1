  #3648: the launcher's Gallery page sent a picture as it was on disk, so a
  phone or camera picture left this machine with its Exif, GPS position
  included, and the site served it to anyone. Gallery.Submit now runs
  MediaStrip.Clean on the bytes before it sends them, by the site's own rules
  (stripMedia in site\server.js).

  WHAT IT CHECKS:
    1. Compiled with the compiler the build runs (Add-LauncherType,
       tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1, #2821) and asked: for every picture and
       recording in tests\fixtures\media-3648.js, MediaStrip.Clean gives
       exactly the bytes the site keeps (the same fixture's clean bytes,
       which site\tests\test-3648-media-metadata.js holds the site to), so what the
       launcher sends and what the site keeps cannot drift apart; none of
       them holds a GPS block or XMP; a clean file comes back as the same
       array; one whose blocks cannot be walked comes back null; and the
       bytes it was given are never changed.
    2. In Gallery.cs (text): Submit cleans the bytes after reading them and
       before PostBytes sends them, sends the cleaned bytes, and refuses to
       send a file that cannot be cleaned, saying why.
    3. The two copies of the rules name each other.

  Read only. node writes the fixtures under the temp folder, and they are
  removed at the end. Off Windows, 1 says SKIP: the build's compiler is only
  there.
