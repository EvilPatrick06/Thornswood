  The launcher's feed watch keeps its socket out of the two connections the
  rest of the launcher shares with thornswood.net.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The .NET Framework, which the launcher ran on until
  #4823, let a program keep two connections to
  a host at a time (ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit), and a request
  waits for a free one inside its own timeout. From #2440 on, an open launcher
  keeps one long-poll to the site's /feed/watch open all the time, fifty
  seconds a wait, and it sat in the same connection group as everything else,
  so the Play page's gallery list, its pictures (up to 5.7 MB each), the voice
  token and the news took turns on the one connection left. A picture held the
  rest back, and a request whose timeout ran out while it waited failed:
  Patrick's launcher.log on 30 Oct, 7:08 PM, says "Voice: could not get a join
  token (The operation has timed out)", and the gallery list read the same way
  leaves Play's card hidden. Patrick's report the same evening: the Play
  gallery goes blank or loads its pictures slowly, where it used to turn
  through them steadily. Updater.Tip then put the watch in a connection group
  of its own (Updater.WatchGroup), which counts its connections apart.

  Since the move to .NET 10 (#4823) the launcher's requests go through
  HttpClient (Http.cs, and Gallery's own), whose SocketsHttpHandler sets no
  limit on the connections to a host unless told to, so the group went with
  the .NET Framework. What has to stay true is the same: the watch's open
  request holds none of the others back.

  What it proves, against a server of its own on 127.0.0.1:
    - with the feed watch held open through Updater.Tip and another request
      held in the same shared client, a third through Http.Send still
      answers at once
    - with the watch held and one picture downloading, the gallery's own
      GetBytes still answers at once
    - no launcher file puts a limit on the connections to a host back

  HOW. Builds the launcher project with the .NET 10 SDK and loads it
  (Add-LauncherAssembly in Launcher-Csc.ps1), as
  test-2636-feed-watch-quiet.ps1 does, and calls Updater.Tip, Http.Send and
  Gallery.GetBytes by reflection. Nothing under C:\Thornswood is read or
  written and nothing leaves 127.0.0.1.

  Runs in pwsh 7 on any system the .NET 10 SDK is on.
