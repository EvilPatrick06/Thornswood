//
// Brewing, enchanting and tempering: the three things that reach the craft
// event with no recipe behind them.
//
// THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GATE DECIDED ON THE OUTPUT'S RECORD TYPE AND ALL
// THREE OF ITS FAULTS CAME FROM THAT. The audit of 21 September found them:
//
//   * a brewed potion HAS NO RECORD. Mixing a potion and enchanting an item
//     both MAKE A NEW FORM, so the id is above 0xff000000 and kindOf, which
//     reads plugin records, answers nothing. The gate refused every brew: the
//     change written to let the Alchemist work was the thing stopping it.
//   * TEMPERING ARRIVES HERE NOW. CraftService throws out the armour table and
//     the sharpening wheel before it considers a recipe, which leaves the
//     recipe list EMPTY, and an empty list is what the fork patch reports
//     rather than drops. A tempered sword is a WEAP, so it read as an
//     enchantment and was refused to every smith in the world.
//   * NOTHING CREDITED THE WORK, so an Alchemist could brew for ever and stay
//     a novice: creditWork is the only road to rankUp.
//
// So the runtime line is the discriminator. Above it something was made from
// nothing and the BENCH says which trade. Below it the item already existed,
// which is tempering, and this gate has no business in it.
//
// BELOW THE LINE WAS A DOOR ROUND THE WHOLE CRAFT GATE (To Do 347g). A craft
// whose list of inputs matched no recipe exactly came below the line and was
// allowed with no race, profession or rank asked. On 23 September a Riekling
// helmet arrived that way listing thirteen entries. So at any bench but the two
// tempering benches, an item a recipe row makes now goes to the real
// craftAnswer, and S9 to S16 below drive it beside the real function, with the
// helmet's own row out of the generated table. An item no row makes, and a
// bench nobody has classified, are still let through.
//
// A TEMPER IS REFUSED NOW (#1384). Tempering is cut and a piece is mended
// with a kit (docs/systems/durability.md), so a craft at the sharpening wheel
// or the armour table is refused to everybody, points at the kit in the
// inventory and never at a command (no chat commands for what people do,
// Patrick, 4 October), and is not credited. S9 and S16 drive it.
