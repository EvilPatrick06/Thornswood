  Each pull request carries its own release note, checked while it is open,
  and a release's note is joined from them (#5179). This drives the pieces:
  Get-PrReleaseNote, Get-PrReleaseNoteProblems and Join-PrReleaseNotes in
  scripts\release\Note-Rules.ps1, the check's own command (thornswood-notes
  in tools\ReleaseNotes, when the .NET SDK is here), and
  scripts\release\Collect-ReleaseNotes.ps1 through -PullsFile, and holds the
  template, the workflow and the guide to the same line.
  tests\test-note-rules-cases.ps1 holds the two copies of the rules to the
  same answers.

  Read only apart from its own temp folder, which it removes.
