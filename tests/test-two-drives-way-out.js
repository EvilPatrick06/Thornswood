//
// Skyrim on one drive and Thornswood on another is a refusal that names the
// way out, not a rule with nothing to press.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Thornswood's own game folder is built from hard links, and
// Windows will not make a hard link across volumes, so OwnGame.WhyNot has
// always refused when the two are apart. What it said was "Skyrim is on D: and
// Thornswood is on C:. Links only work inside one drive, so Thornswood has to
// be installed on the same drive as Skyrim for this." That is where it ended:
// a rule, no path, no button, nothing to do next. And since Play began
// refusing to start out of a shared Skyrim (Shell.OwnGameRequired), that
// sentence stopped being a feature nobody could have and became the whole
// game for anybody who keeps their Steam library on a second drive.
//
// WHAT THIS HOLDS THE LAUNCHER TO.
//   1. The dead end sentence is gone from the launcher.
//   2. Both cross-drive answers still refuse, through OneDriveOnly. The links
//      are settled design, so this is not a place to start copying 26 to 41 GB
//      instead, quietly or otherwise.
//   3. The answer names both sides by path and by drive letter, and both ways
//      out: install Thornswood on the other drive, which lands in
//      <drive>\Thornswood, or move the other side to Thornswood's drive. Each
//      way out is somebody else's screen, so each says which one and which
//      buttons: Steam, Settings, Storage for the Steam library, and Vortex,
//      Settings, Mods for Vortex's staging folder.
//   4. It stays one sentence with no line break. The same string goes to a
//      MessageBox, to the card in Settings, to the one line status strip on
//      the Play page and to Profile\launcher.log, which is one entry to a line.
//   5. Everything that shows WhyNot's answer shows all of it, so the drive
//      letters and the two ways out are what the person reads.
//
// Read only.
