// test-creation-docs.js
//
// The public pages say where a new character's choices are made, and they say
// what the game actually does.
//
// From the To Do List, entry 162: "Nothing in the creation hall is a choice,
// and it is where your face is made but not anything else", and the end state
// it names is that the published line on Known Issues "is no longer true".
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED, 24 September. The launcher chooses nothing any more:
// 3aa37ef on 20 September ("Pick your character at the game's main menu, not
// in the launcher") took Creation.cs out, and c87da23 the same afternoon moved
// class, profession and home onto the K panel in the hall. beginChoosing in
// gamemode.js opens that panel by itself once the face is made, the character
// block ends creation the moment a home is picked, and the panel offers
// "Choose later" for class and profession and never for the home. But the two
// pages anybody can read without signing in, /known and /help (the known board
// and help.md), still said the opposite:
//
//   known.md  "Your profession, half, class and town are chosen in the
//              launcher before Play, and the hall holds nothing to pick up
//              or read"
//   known.md  "Everything else about a new character is decided in the
//              launcher"
//   help.md   "the launcher is the only place they are made", and "with the
//              tools of your trade in your pack", when a2ba2ee on 21
//              September hands a tool to three picks and nothing to the rest.
//
// So this reads what the code does and then reads what the pages say, and
// fails when they disagree. Each claim about the game is checked against the
// file that makes it true, not against a sentence copied into this harness,
// so a page that goes stale again fails here rather than in front of a tester.
//
// Read only.
