// test-1887-shared-waits.js
//
// #1887. The fisher and hunter pages said a water's and a rack's wait was kept
// per person and cleared by a restart. Since #1413 the server keeps both on the
// reference, in the shared resource stock (createSharedResourceStock), shared
// by everyone and kept through a restart, which is what People who are not
// people says ("Return times and shared stock survive a restart"). The pages
// now say the same. This holds the two pages to the server: fish() and game()
// ask the stock about the reference and nothing else, the stock keeps its wait
// in a property on the reference, and neither page says the wait is yours or
// that a restart clears it. tests/test-resource-stock-integration.js runs the
// stock itself, the sharing and the reload.
//
// Read only.
