      pwsh .\tests\test-remirror-feed.ps1

  Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 puts the tip version.json on the site along with every
  asset it names, so /feed/version.json and /feed/assets/<sha256> match
  Thornswood-Releases. Publish-Update.ps1 -HostAssetUrls has written those urls
  since the #649 cutover, and until this script nothing sent the bytes.

  What is checked, all against scratch files and without connecting to
  anything:

    the block that works out which assets the feed needs, run on its own
      between its markers: host assets are collected in feed order, a GitHub
      url is counted and not mirrored, a url for the other channel is named
      and refused, a dev run records a /feed/ url instead of warning,
      the same sha named twice is one asset, and an entry with no
      url is skipped;
    the whole script with -Check, in a child PowerShell, against a scratch feed
      and a scratch asset folder: it says which assets it would send and which
      are missing, and sends nothing.

  The dry run needs ssh on the path only to find out that it cannot reach a
  VPS; it is pointed at an address that answers nothing, and -Check is the
  switch that makes an unreachable site a line on screen rather than a stop.
