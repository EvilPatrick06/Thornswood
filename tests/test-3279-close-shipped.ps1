  test-3279-close-shipped.ps1

  scripts\release\Close-ShippedIssues.ps1, which a main Ship runs after it
  tags the release: every open issue in Done whose done-on-merge comment names
  a merge the shipped commit contains is closed, with the test task from that
  comment as its closing comment, and every other one stays open, said.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #3279. done-on-merge.yml (#2796) moves a noticeable
  fix's issue to Done at the merge and writes its test task on it "for when a
  main Ship carries it", and nothing did that close: it was a hand step for
  whoever ran the Ship, and on 22 Oct two threads closed fixes at the merge
  instead, before any main Ship carried them.

  What it checks, in a scratch git repository with a merge before the shipped
  commit and one after, a board.json in the shape board-read.yml writes, and
  stand-ins for gh and Invoke-RestMethod that answer from a table and write
  down every call:
    1. an issue in Done whose merge is in the release gets one comment holding
       exactly the test task, then is closed as completed, in that order;
    2. one whose merge came after the release stays open, and so does one
       whose last done-on-merge comment names the later merge;
    3. one with a person's newer "Test task:" for main is closed with no
       second comment; a newer Server: Dev one keeps nothing open and the
       Main block is still written; a Dev block is written unless a newer
       Dev one stands, whatever Main one is beside it (Patrick, 22 Oct: the
       two are for different people, and a Dev one may stay while on main);
    4. one with no done-on-merge comment, or one only a person wrote with the
       same footer, stays open, listed;
    5. a card not in Done, a closed issue and another repository's are not
       read at all, and a comment on the second page of 100 is found;
    6. -Check writes nothing and says what it would close;
    7. a refused close is a stop: exit 1, the issue named, the command that
       runs it again printed, and the others still closed;
    8. a shallow checkout and a commit the checkout does not hold stop before
       anything is read;
    9. an issue moved to Done by hand (#3411), with a person's "Fixed by
       <merge> (pull request #N)." line: closed with the test task in its
       block, or with no comment when it says "No test task: nobody would
       notice this fix."; kept open when the merge is not in the release; the
       newer of it and a done-on-merge comment stands; and a line with
       neither a block nor the no-task line is a stop;
   10. a merge this checkout does not hold stays open only when GitHub says
       it is on main; one that is not (an id from before main's history was
       rewritten, #3684), or that GitHub does not know, is a stop naming it,
       and the issues beside it are still closed.

  It never reaches GitHub. Files under its own temp folder only.
