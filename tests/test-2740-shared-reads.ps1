  Issue #2740. The gamemode now writes online.json, online-names.json and
  allowed.json whole through the engine's mp.writeFileWhole: a new file
  beside the old one, renamed over it with POSIX semantics. That rename is
  refused while a reader has the file open WITHOUT share-delete, and
  Get-Content opens without it (FileShare ReadWrite). The deploys and
  Set-Door read these files on the box while the server runs, so every one of
  those reads opens the file sharing ReadWrite and Delete.

  And the band-aid that covered the in-place write comes out with it:
  Deploy-DevGamemode's Warn-DevRoom slept two seconds and read online.json a
  second time when the first read landed on a write. The gamemode's write is
  whole now, so a read gets one count or the other, and there is one read.

  WHAT IT HOLDS IT TO.
    1. Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 (Get-DevRoom), Deploy-Server.ps1
       (Get-LiveOnline) and Set-Door.ps1 read online.json, online-names.json
       and allowed.json through a FileStream sharing ReadWrite and Delete,
       never Get-Content.
    2. Warn-DevRoom looks once: no Start-Sleep, no second Get-DevRoom.
    3. In this shell and in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the box runs these
       reads with it): the read the deploys send, run while the file is
       replaced by a POSIX rename (Feed-Store.ps1's Move-FeedStoreInto, the
       same rename as the engine's), does not stop the rename and reads the
       old count whole; Get-Content's open does stop it.

  -Repo runs it against another checkout's scripts (main before #2740 fails
  1, 2 and 3). Nothing outside its own temp folder is written.
