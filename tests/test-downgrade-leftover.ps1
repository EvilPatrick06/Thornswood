  The Downgrade button removes a depot folder an earlier attempt left behind
  before it asks Steam for that part, and keeps one this build finished.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. A tester on launcher 1.1.94, 25 September. Part 1 came
  down and Steam said "Depot download complete". The launcher opened Steam's
  console again for part 2 and nothing was typed, and the card said "8,169 MB
  down so far (Steam shows the rest in its console)" and never moved (Patrick:
  "it correctly put the first command in it finnished and than it redid the
  open console command and stopped"). Depot 489832 is 7,260 MB at 1.6.1170,
  so that folder was there from an attempt at another build before Steam was
  asked for anything. With it there:

    1. the check for whether Steam took the command passed at once, on the
       folder being there, so the second try at the console never ran;
    2. the card showed that folder's size where it should have said the
       command was on the clipboard and where to paste it;
    3. Steam fills a depot folder without emptying it, so the other build's
       files would have been copied over the game with the 1.6.1170 ones.

  HOW. ClearLeftover, MarkerIs and FolderSize are lifted out of
  launcher\app\Downgrade.cs by brace match and compiled with the compiler the
  build runs (tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1), and run against folders
  made under a temp folder. Run itself drives Steam's window and cannot be run
  here, so where it calls ClearLeftover is read from its text. Nothing here
  opens Steam or touches Steam's folders.
