  test-install-server.ps1

  Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1, and Publish-Server.ps1 that sends it, never
  stop or remove the running server before the new one has checked out, and
  put the old one back when the new one does not answer.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #446: "A failed publish deletes the live server before
  checking the new one". Until 28 September the installer stopped the server,
  deleted the whole root, unpacked the payload into the empty folder, and only
  then checked the load order, so a payload naming a plugin it did not carry
  left no server at all; Publish-Server stopped it even earlier, before the
  copy, and said "Nothing local was changed". The issue's own Done when: a
  payload with a plugin missing from the load order leaves the old root byte
  for byte as it was, and the old server still answers.

  HOW. The installer is run by Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is what runs it on
  the VPS, against a root in a scratch folder, with -AllowGamingPc so it runs on
  a machine with the game on it. The payloads are real zips. The server in
  them is a node stub that holds its game port on UDP and its resources port on
  TCP the way skymp5-server does, and dies on start, or never opens the
  resources port, when its gamemode says so. The scheduled task cmdlets are the
  only stand-ins: functions in front of them keep a task in a file and start
  its real action, cmd.exe and all, so nothing here registers a real task.
  Publish-Server.ps1 is driven whole, with ssh and scp replaced by functions
  that run the same thing against the scratch folder, the way
  test-remote-big-script.ps1 replaces them.

  It proves:
    - a first install unpacks, answers and records what the payload shipped
    - a payload naming a plugin it does not carry, a zip that arrived
      different, a gamemode that does not parse and a binary that is not its
      recorded build are each INSTALL REFUSED with the root byte for byte as
      it was and the same server process still answering
    - a payload that does not start is INSTALL ROLLED BACK: the old root back
      as it was, answering again, the new one kept as .failed to read
    - a good one swaps in, carries the world, the roster, the runtime data and
      the logs across, keeps the old root as .prev and the newest two of them
    - -PutBack puts the newest .prev back and keeps what it took out
    - issue #2491: -TaskOnly registers the task again over one with no start
      /high, restarts the server under it with node at High, and changes no
      file; with a switch that would change one it is INSTALL REFUSED
    - a root that cannot be moved because something holds a file in it is
      INSTALL REFUSED, and the old server is started again
    - -FreshWorld starts with no world and leaves the old one in .prev
    - Publish-Server.ps1 exits 1 on a refused payload without having stopped
      anything, and publishes and puts back through the same installer
    - issue #1222: a running server's own settings survive an install, a
      put-back and a Publish-Server on the dev channel and on the live one
      (every thornswood switch, npcSettings, the name, the port), with only
      the load order, the start point and how many it holds taken from the
      payload; a payload's npcSettings "default" key never reaches a running
      server, and a first install of one is refused; settings that moved
      under the install between its stage and its swap put the old folder
      back before anything starts (INSTALL ROLLED BACK)
    - issue #1214: a payload with no build record is refused, and so is a
      Publish-Server whose zip holds a binary the record does not name
    - issue #1804: a running server with no join pass switch is INSTALL
      REFUSED with the root as it was and the same process answering, and
      with -RequirePass on it is INSTALL OK with the switch set and read
      back; a first install of a payload with none is refused, and goes in
      with -RequirePass off. The payloads here carry a switch otherwise.
    - issue #459: a Publish-Server that answered records what the box runs
      (the gamemode artifact in the store, data\thornswood-deploy.json and
      the store's current record, and the engine in the site's
      deployed-build.json, #2303); a refused one records nothing; the old
      folder keeps its own record rather than handing it to the new one; and
      -PutBack records the folder that came back by its own record. The
      Publish-Server payloads carry this checkout's gamemode artifact and a
      stamp for the channel, as Export-ServerPayload.ps1 makes them, so they
      are told apart by what they ship into data.
    - issue #2323: every stub server here starts on ports below the range
      Windows hands to outgoing connections, each pair bound before it is
      handed out, so a block Windows keeps for TCP or a connection that took
      the port cannot stop a start the case expects to answer.

# BELOW THE RANGE WINDOWS HANDS OUT, AND PROVED BY BINDING BOTH (#2323). The
# dev and live pairs used to be asked of the system (UdpClient(0)), which
# answers from the dynamic range, 49152 and up. Two things there stopped a
# stub from ever answering, measured on One on 12 Oct:
#   - Windows reserves blocks of that range for TCP alone (netsh int ipv4 show
#     excludedportrange: 49709-49808, 50321-50420, 51343-51442, 63701-63800
#     and 63874-63973 that day). A UDP port handed out next to one has its
#     TCP port above inside it, nothing holds it, so "free" said yes, and the
#     stub's listen failed with EACCES.
#   - every outgoing connection on the machine takes its own port from the
#     same range, so the port above can be taken between the choice and the
#     start.
#   A start with either never answers. Of 35 stub starts that day, the same
#   cmd, roll-log and node chain the installer registers, on random ports in
#   that range, 3 never answered: the stub's log said EACCES on 49731, inside
#   49709-49808, and EACCES on 50426 with an established connection on it.
#   On 11 Oct the two live Publish-Server cases failed together in one run,
#   the way a live pair whose resources port cannot be listened on fails: the
#   first install had no old folder to go back to, so it was INSTALL FAILED
#   after the swap and the lock, and the one over it rolled back and kept its
#   .failed folder.
# So ports come from below the dynamic range, which no outgoing connection is
# given, and each pair is bound here, UDP and TCP the way the stub binds them,
# before it is handed out: a reserved block, wherever it is, refuses the bind.
