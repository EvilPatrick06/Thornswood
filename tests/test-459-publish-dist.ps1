      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-459-publish-dist.ps1

  Publish-Server.ps1 names the built server it packs (#459, the same defect
  #2309 found in Deploy-DevGamemode -LoadOrder). The deploys run only from a
  clean checkout at origin (#2118), which on the shipping machine is a fresh
  worktree, and a fresh worktree has no engine build. Publish-Server's -Dist
  defaulted to Where.ps1 ServerDist inside that checkout, so from the one
  place the guard lets it run it skipped the gamemode copy and the start
  point check without a word and stopped inside Export-ServerPayload with
  "server dist not found", naming neither -Dist nor the build the record
  wants. And the default was worked out in the parameter block, where
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 leaves $PSScriptRoot empty (#2229).

  A publish needs a built server, so -Dist stays: left out it is the
  checkout's own engine build and never another folder, and with no build
  there the publish stops before anything is copied, built or sent, saying
  how to name one.

  HOW. A scratch git repository stands in for a fresh checkout: the scripts,
  the records, layout.json and game\gamemode.js, committed, and no engine.
  ssh and scp are stand-ins on PATH that only write down that they were
  called, and the box is 127.0.0.1 with THORNSWOOD_HARNESS set, so the
  freshness guard lets the scratch checkout be. It proves:
    1. with no -Dist, from the fresh checkout, the publish stops naming the
       checkout's own build folder, -Dist and the engine commit the record
       names, before the gamemode artifact is built and with no ssh or scp;
       the same under Windows PowerShell 5.1 when this machine has it;
    2. -Dist naming no folder, or a folder with no server-settings.json, stops
       the same way, naming that folder;
    3. -Dist naming a built server goes past that stop, and a build that is
       not the one records\server-build.json names is still refused before
       anything is copied (the shared clone's build of another engine commit
       is this case);
    4. the parameter block works nothing out: -Dist and -Zip have no default.

  Everything it writes is in its own temp folder. Nothing connects anywhere.
