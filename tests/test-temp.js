// Temperature: where you are standing, what you are wearing, and the fire.
//
// Patrick, 23 September, with five screenshots of the meter reading Fine 50
// outside at night, beside a brazier, inside the Bannered Mare and standing in
// its fire pit: "not any warmer when near or in fire or in a building also
// make so if you are in a fire you catch on fire". Then "yeah forges and stuff
// like that should be included too because they are hot", and "also clothing
// should affect temperature depening on what clothes and if you are weaing
// them no clothes should equal colder some clothes/armor should be hotter than
// others etc".
//
// THE METER WAS NEVER WRONG. Nothing ever told it where anybody was standing,
// so every one of those screenshots is the same bug: n.place was '' and the
// target was always comfort. So the first thing this checks is that the two
// halves are actually joined up - that the client reports, that the server has
// a number for every word the client can send, and that the fire table the
// client scans with is the one the builder wrote.
//
// It drives the REAL needs block out of gamemode.js over a fake mp and a fake
// clock, the way test-needs.js does.
