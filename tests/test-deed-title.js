// test-deed-title.js
//
// The deed is the title. Carrying it to the door takes the property.
//
// /claim has told people this since it was written: "Whoever carries it holds
// the place, so keep it somewhere a thief will not look." Nothing in the file
// did it. holderOf read the register and the register only, so a stolen deed
// was a piece of paper and the message was a promise the code did not keep.
//
// Patrick's design, 21 September: a thief who lifts the deed takes the house,
// and a transfer is an act at a door between two people rather than something
// an item does in a pocket. Carrying the deed and opening the door IS that act.
// It cannot happen in a pocket because it needs the door, and handing somebody
// the deed is the same gesture whether it is a sale, a gift or a theft, which
// is the point: the server does not need to tell those apart.
//
// WHY THE DOOR IS SAFE TO HANG IT ON, and this is measured rather than chosen:
// a LOCKED door is never announced to the server at all, on purpose, so that
// Skyrim's own lockpicking keeps working. So every press that reaches this code
// is a door that was already open to whoever pressed it.
//
// Read only.
