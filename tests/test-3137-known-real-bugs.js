// The Known Issues page lists only what is actually broken, and every row of
// it is an issue on the board. What works the way it does on purpose is not
// listed anywhere: Patrick, 26 Oct, 11:42 AM, on Help's Things that are normal
// here: "we can just remove that whole section from help, this ism just
// clutter people arent fucking that stupid". So that section is gone too, and
// nothing points at it.
//
// Issue #3137, Patrick: "we need to add any of the known issues ion the discor
// or the website to the issues boards and get them fixed aswell as remove
// things that arent know issues like things that we removed how things work
// that we did on purpose etc and only put things that are actually
// broken/issues".
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED ON 26 OCTOBER. The live page (/api/page/known) was the
// repo's known board but for one sentence #2703 had not deployed. It had
// fourteen rows and three prose sections. Read against the board and the code:
//   - real and on the board: mod scripts never fire (#503), killmoves (#2710);
//   - real with no open issue: the menus that still reset (#488 closed with
//     them left, now #3435); the tester note's instruments (#3434) and typing
//     in another window (#3436) were not on the page or the board at all;
//   - fixed: NPC behaviour differing near the same enemy (#504 closed, the
//     server runs the NPCs);
//   - no longer true: fishing "no rod needed" (the server asks for a pole);
//   - on purpose: the mods the collection took out, what the server owns, the
//     bare creation hall, leaving with no class, an old launcher, the load
//     order rule. Those went to help.md's Things that are normal here, which
//     Patrick then removed whole (26 Oct).
// The old harnesses for the sections that came off (test-known-npcs.js for the
// NPC section, test-known-page.js for the table of removed mods) went with
// them, since what they checked is no longer on the page by decision.
//
// A row recorded its issue as "issue" beside its cells. Since #3140 the rows
// are the board's own Findings issues, written out by the bot, so there is no
// typed row left; the checks of the rows went with them.
//
// Read only.
