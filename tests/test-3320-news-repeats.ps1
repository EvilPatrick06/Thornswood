  Each post says only what is new on its channel (#3320). Offline: a folder
  stands in for the site and the VPS store ($env:THORNSWOOD_TEST_SITE_DIR),
  so nothing connects anywhere.

    - Note-Repeats.ps1 finds a title or "- " line a channel's feed or its
      Discord posts already had, says where, and leaves alone the lines the
      publisher writes itself and a release shipped again with its own note.
    - Get-ChannelPosts reads both records, and Add-AnnouncedPost keeps forty.
    - Ship.ps1 and Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 run the check before anything is
      built or sent, and -ShipFollows posts nothing.
    - Publish-Discord.ps1 remembers the lines of every post, gamemode
      deploys included.
    - Clean-NewsRepeats.ps1 takes the 22 Oct repeats out of a feed, keeps
      each note's title and the publisher's own lines, and -Check sends
      nothing.
