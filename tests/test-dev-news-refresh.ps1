  The dev feed's DEV marks follow main without a dev release, and a Ship that
  released nothing tells nobody.

  WHAT HAPPENED. Measured on 6 Oct 2026 at about 11 AM: the dev feed had 40
  notes, 27 marked DEV, and mainVersion 1.1.106, while main had shipped 1.2.0
  (release 20261005-235125, from 1c0caabe) after the last dev Ship. Three
  faults kept it so:

    1. a dev publish with nothing new stopped at "Nothing to do" before the
       marks were worked out, so a dev Ship made to bring them up to date left
       them as they were;
    2. that "Nothing to do" exited 0 without -Launcher, which is how a Ship
       that keeps its launcher runs it (#921), and Ship read 0 as a release: it
       posted the previous night's note to the dev updates channel again and
       told the dev server "update in 5 min";
    3. a main Ship never touched the dev feed, so after every main release
       the dev News tab marked finished work DEV until somebody shipped dev.

  WHAT THIS DRIVES, all offline: a folder stands in for the site and the VPS
  store (-SiteDir, the same script the VPS runs, Feed-Store.ps1), a scratch git
  repository stands in for the clone whose history proves what main has, and
  stand-in scripts stand in for the Discord post, the site news, the remirror
  and the server notice.

    1. Update-DevFeedMarks (Dev-News.ps1) on the 27-mark shape: 3 notes with a
       sourceCommit (one on main by ancestry, one squash merged, one main never
       took) and 24 from before sourceCommit, whose own dev release (found by
       its tag) main has, while the dev feed's newest release is ahead of
       main (#2401). 26 lose the mark, 1 keeps it; old notes whose release was
       built with uncommitted files, or that no tag holds, keep the mark they
       have. mainVersion follows main, and only the dev
       feed's version.json is sent: no pack, no release record, no news entry,
       no baseline. A second run sends nothing. -NoSend sends nothing. No main
       feed, or a store that moved since it was read, sends nothing.
    2. Refresh-DevNews.ps1, the command a person runs, end to end.
    3. The real Publish-Update.ps1 on the dev channel: a release, then the
       same build again with the marks gone stale. It exits 2, makes no
       release and no news entry, and the store's dev feed has the marks
       main says. With -NoPush it sends nothing.
    4. Ship.ps1 from the publisher on, run with stand-ins: a publish with
       nothing new posts nothing and tells no server, says nothing was
       released and how the marks went; a publisher that says 0 without naming
       a release is not announced; a main Ship refreshes the dev marks after
       the remirror, and a refresh that fails does not fail the release.

  Everything it writes is under its own temp folder, which it removes.
