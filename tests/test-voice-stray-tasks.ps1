  Installing voice takes off any other task that starts voice-server.js from
  the root it installs, and leaves another root's alone (#2008).

  WHY. scripts\oneoff\Fix-Voice.ps1 registered ThornswoodVoice on the VPS on
  13 September: at boot, node "C:\Thornswood-Voice\voice-server.js" in
  C:\Thornswood-Voice, with none of the environment Install-Voice's task
  sets, so no auth and no loopback bind. It was still there, Ready, on
  5 October, beside Thornswood Voice, and after a reboot whichever of the two
  got port 7778 first was live voice.

  HOW. Install-Voice builds its task on the VPS in a script it sends there, a
  here-string. That here-string is found and read as the script the box runs,
  and its RemoveStrayTasks function taken out of it and run here, with the
  installer's own $Root and $TaskName, against three tasks registered for the
  person running this (no elevation needed):
    a stray one that starts voice-server.js from the root, by working folder;
    the install's own task, also in the root;
    another root's, whose folder only begins like this one.
  The stray goes, the other two stay. A second stray, named by its full path
  with another working folder, goes too.

  -InstallVoice reads another copy, so the same test runs on the one from
  before this change:

      git show origin/main:scripts/deploy/Install-Voice.ps1 > $env:TEMP\voice-before.ps1
      pwsh -NoProfile -File .\tests\test-voice-stray-tasks.ps1 -InstallVoice $env:TEMP\voice-before.ps1

  Registers and removes tasks named Thornswood stray harness <guid> ... (not
  'Thornswood Test...', which other harnesses clear away, #1135). Nothing is
  started; writes nothing else.
