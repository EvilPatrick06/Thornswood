  test-remote-length.ps1

  No script sends the VPS more than a command line can hold.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. sshd on Windows hands the command to cmd.exe, which stops
  at 8,191 characters. Base64 of UTF-16 is about 2.7 times the script, so a
  block of any size arrives CUT IN HALF and nothing anywhere says so: the far
  end sees a script that stops mid-line and complains about a brace or an
  unexpected token, naming a line above the one that was actually cut. On
  20 September a deploy failed that way with "Unexpected token '$?'" fifteen
  lines above the truncation.

  Deploy-Docs.ps1 solved it on 17 September and sixteen scripts were given the
  fix on 20 September, which is entry 115 on the To Do List. MEASURED AGAIN ON
  23 SEPTEMBER, two were still wrong and neither had ever worked:
  Install-Voice.ps1 sent 24,350 characters, which is the entire install of the
  voice service, and Check-Site.ps1 sent 17,802 because it carries a node
  script base64 inside its remote block.

  So it is checked here rather than remembered. A script that sends an encoded
  command and carries a here-string too long to fit must also carry the guard
  that sends it as a file instead.

  HOW IT DECIDES, and it is deliberately blunt: the longest here-string in the
  file, on the assumption that it is the one that goes up. That over-reports
  for a file whose big here-string is only ever scp'd, and the answer to a
  false red is to add the guard anyway, which costs one round trip on a script
  that was already sending one. Being wrong in the quiet direction is what
  this is here to stop.

  Read only. Never connects to anything.
