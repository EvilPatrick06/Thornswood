// test-boards.js
//
// The nine notice board sites, and the one thing that makes changing them
// hard: boards are SAVED.
//
// Djinn, 22 September, in "Borad location coords": nine towns with a facing
// each, and "Suggest allocation then verification and orientation" under them.
// The boards were seeded at each hold's inn before that, out of the chargen
// arrival table, because those were the only positions this server had ever
// stood anybody on.
//
// WHAT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH. `boards` lives in the register beside the claims
// and the notices, and that file is written every time anything in it is. So
// on any server that has been played on, loadPart('boards') answers and the
// seeding is never reached again: a new table of coordinates would move the
// boards on a fresh server and on no other. The fix would read perfectly and
// nothing in the world would change, which is the same shape as the seam that
// could not be written and the harness that passed all evening.
//
// So most of what is below is about the SAVED case, not the fresh one.
//
// Read only.
