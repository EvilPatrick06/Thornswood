  Clear-OldWorldCopies.ps1 removes the world copies every server install
  before #446 left in the VPS temp folder, keeps the newest of each kind, and
  never goes anywhere it should not (issue #1074).

  It runs the real script against two scratch temp folders holding
  world-, serverdata-, serverprivate- and serverlogs- folders of several
  stamps, a folder with a link in it, folders with names that only look like
  those, and a file with such a name, and checks:
    - -WhatIf adds them up and removes nothing
    - a real run removes all but the newest of each kind, from both folders
    - it says how much each kind held
    - a folder holding a link is left, and said, and what the link points at
      is untouched
    - nothing not named exactly like the installer named them is touched
    - -IncludeNewest removes the newest too once a backup newer than them is
      there, and keeps them while there is none
    - it refuses a machine that is not the box (scripts\vps\BoxGuard.ps1)
  Touches nothing but its scratch folder.
