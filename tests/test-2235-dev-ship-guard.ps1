# test-2235-dev-ship-guard.ps1
#
# #2235: Ship -Channel dev checked the checkout with -AnyBranch, then, after
# building, signing and installing the launcher, called Publish-Update, which
# checked without it and refused the same branch as "diverged from
# origin/main". Both now ask Test-FreshAnyBranch (scripts\deploy\
# Fresh-Checkout.ps1) with their -Channel, and Ship hands Publish-Update its
# -AllowStaleCheckout.
#
# A. The rule, against scratch git repos: a bare "origin" in a temp folder and
#    clones of it, so git never leaves this machine. Each case asks the two
#    questions exactly as Ship and Publish-Update now ask them, and they must
#    agree: the reported case (a pushed dev branch behind main), a branch for
#    a main release, a hotfix/ branch, a branch never pushed, a dirty one.
#    The old Publish-Update question is asked too, to show the case it broke.
# B. The scripts: both call Test-FreshAnyBranch with $Channel, Ship asks
#    before it builds anything, and Ship passes -AllowStaleCheckout on.
# Ship and Publish-Update are never run. Runs under Stop, as 5.1 would.
