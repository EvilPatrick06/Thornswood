  The launcher's own update is applied only once every file in it was
  checked, and a refusal applies nothing.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. On the To Do List as "The launcher's self update destroys
  the old exe and has no way back", and #912, the signer check that read a
  name anybody can put on a certificate. Until #4825 this harness drove the
  swap script in launcher\app\SelfSwap.cs. Velopack replaced it: it keeps the
  version before in its packages folder and puts a new one in from a process
  of its own (launcher\app\VeloUpdate.cs), so the way back is Velopack's and
  is not driven here. What stays ours, and is proved here, is what is checked
  before Velopack is asked to apply anything.

  WHAT IT DOES. Builds the whole launcher the way the project builds
  (tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1) with a driver beside it, and runs the driver:
    - VeloPackage.Refusal, on packages it makes: a game file with other
      bytes, another size, one the signed list does not name, one missing;
      a file beside them that differs from setup-files.<channel>.json, or is
      missing; a file nobody listed; a name that climbs out of its folder; a
      setup list that names a program; and a package with no program. Each
      is refused, with the reason in words.
    - On Windows, an unsigned launcher and an unsigned Update.exe in a
      package whose every other file matches are refused by
      Signature.Refusal, and the copy taken out to check leaves nothing in
      the temp folder. With a signed launcher (-Signed, by default the dev
      install's), that package passes, and with one byte of the launcher
      changed it is refused. Off Windows these say SKIP: Signature.Refusal
      asks WinVerifyTrust.
    - Updater.ApplyLauncher refuses an update FetchLauncher did not pass,
      and no update at all, and nothing then waits for the launcher to close;
      the same call on an update marked checked is held for the close, so the
      refusals were for that alone. Velo.ExitApply is never called.
  FetchLauncher itself needs Velopack's download and the release's signed
  record from GitHub, so what it does in what order is read from its source:
  the package check, then the Update.exe check, then the mark that it passed,
  and a refusal deletes the package and replaces nothing.

  Writes only under its own temp folder and out\harness (the build). Nothing
  touches the network.
