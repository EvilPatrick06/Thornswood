// The Ready card on the launcher's Play page has an Open Steam button while
// Steam is not running, and notices Steam starting or closing by itself (#3204).
//
// WHAT HAPPENED. Patrick, 21 Oct 2026, 6:30 PM: "when steam isn't running it
// needs to say not running instead of running and a button to open steam".
// The wording was fixed with #3203. Two things were left. Nothing on the card
// opened Steam. And the rows were drawn on a page change, a scan or a recheck
// and at no other time, so Steam closed after that still read "running", and
// Steam started by hand left "Steam not running" up until somebody changed
// page.
//
// THE FIX. Ui.xaml has BtnOpenSteam on the Ready card, shown by
// UpdateReadySummary whenever the Steam row is one of the failing rows, and
// Shell.OpenSteam opens Steam's window through steam://open/main
// (Downgrade.AskSteam, which falls back to steam.exe itself). The window's two
// second tick asks Checks.SteamStillRunning, a watch on steam.exe's handle the
// way GameStillRunning watches the game (#978), and redraws the rows when the
// answer differs from what the Steam row last said.
//
// What this checks:
//   A. ui.xaml: BtnOpenSteam is on the Ready card, starts collapsed, and has a
//      row of its own under the words.
//   B. Shell.cs: the button is found, pressing it runs OpenSteam, OpenSteam asks
//      Steam for steam://open/main, and UpdateReadySummary shows it only while
//      the Steam row fails.
//   C. Shell.cs: DrawStatus records what the Steam row said, and the tick
//      redraws when Steam's answer differs from it, only while not playing.
//   D. Checks.cs: the Steam row is named by SteamRow, and SteamStillRunning is
//      a Watched over steam.exe.
//
// Read only.
