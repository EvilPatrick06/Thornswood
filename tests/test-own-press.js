// Only the person's own press is a press.
//
// Patrick, 21 September, from playing it: "Theres a weird thing when yoiu walk
// my quarries an npc will spawn and force you to start mining when one you
// didnt click on it and two you have no pickaxe and arent a miner".
//
// MEASURED IN HIS OWN TWO CLIPS, frames pulled at one every ten seconds:
// he walks past the Whiterun farms and the quarry with nothing under the
// crosshair, and the chat fills up on its own:
//
//   Thornswood: Only a miner can work a seam. Ask one.     x4
//   Thornswood: Only a farmer can bring a crop in. Ask one. x3
//
// and at the end of the second clip an NPC is standing over him while he is
// down in the mining pose.
//
// WHY. sp.on('activate') fires for EVERY activation in the loaded area, by
// anybody. The comment on the log line inside the handler already said so:
// "every door an NPC opens and every crate anybody walks past". Whiterun's
// own miners and farmhands work their seams and their crops all day. The
// handler had no idea whose press it was holding, so the ACTI branch at the
// bottom re-activated the thing AS THE PERSON, with pc out of
// Game.getPlayer(). That ran the vanilla mine script on him, which is the
// animation and the marker he read as an NPC spawning, and the client
// forwarded the same activation to the server, which is where the seven
// refusals came from: the server was answering presses he never made.
//
// caster is the actionRef out of TESActivateEvent, set beside target in
// EventHandler.cpp in the fork. 0x14 is the person's own reference.
//
// This lifts the shipped handler out of thornswood-front.js and drives it.
// Nothing that decides anything is stubbed: the handler is the real text.
//
// Read only.
