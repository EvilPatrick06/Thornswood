  test-deploy-swaps.ps1

  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1, Deploy-Docs.ps1, Install-Voice.ps1, Install-Bot.ps1
  and Deploy-Server.ps1 -PutBack, each run whole against a scratch folder
  standing in for the VPS: nothing running is stopped or written over until the
  new copy has checked out beside it, a new copy that does not come up is put
  back automatically, and -PutBack puts the last one back.

  NIGHTLY CLOCK: 600 seconds. Every case runs a deploy script whole, each
  run 5 to 25 seconds on the VPS runner (10 to 60 on One with Defender busy),
  so the whole file does not fit the nightly's 300 s clock for one harness:
  on 12 Oct (run 38204529995) the runner was 93 checks in, every one passing,
  when 300 s ran out and it was killed (#1273). nightly.yml reads this line.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #446. Measured on 28 September: Deploy-DevGamemode
  stopped the dev server and then copied over it; Deploy-Docs, Install-Voice and
  Install-Bot copied over the running site, voice service and bot and then
  restarted them; none of them put anything back when the new one did not come
  up, and two of them said so only in a line nobody had to read. Deploy-Server
  already staged, checked and swapped (entry 209); these use its blocks, or the
  same shape for a service (scripts\deploy\Swap.ps1).

  HOW. Each script is copied into a scratch repository with stand-ins for what
  it sends (a site, a voice service and a bot that each report which version
  they are, and a game server that holds its two ports), and run by this
  PowerShell with ssh and scp replaced by functions, the way
  test-remote-big-script.ps1 replaces them. The ssh stand-in runs what it is
  sent under Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is what runs it on the VPS, with only
  the scheduled task and firewall cmdlets replaced: a task is a file here, and
  starting it starts its real action. The scp stand-in copies into the scratch
  folder, and can be told to fail or to corrupt a file. The stops, the
  renames, the health checks and the way back are the real ones.

  For each of them it proves: a good one is swapped in and answers as the new
  version with what it replaced kept in .prev; a copy that fails, or a stage
  the box refuses (a file that arrived different, a program that does not
  parse), stops the run with the running copy untouched and the same process
  still answering; a new version that does not come up, or a swap whose rename
  fails because a file is held, is SWAP ROLLED BACK with the old files back
  and the old version answering again; and -PutBack puts the previous version
  back and keeps what it took out in .undone.

  For the bot it also proves that a box with no bot.log on it is not a failed
  swap: the log the health check reads is made in front of the start, the
  service is started, and the new code stays in, rather than being put back
  after two waits on a file nothing could write.

  And issue #1121, Patrick, 29 Sep: a deploy sends a commit or nothing. Each
  of Deploy-Docs, Install-Voice, Install-Bot, Deploy-DevGamemode,
  Deploy-Server and Publish-Server, run with a file it would send changed,
  staged, or untracked, is refused before it talks to the box, naming the
  file, with no ssh or scp run at all. And only the newest two .prev folders
  are kept, not three.

  And issue #1973: two copies run at once, by two sessions, must both pass.
  Each run's scratch tasks and bot service carry a tag of its own (Thornswood
  Test <tag> ..., ThornswoodTest<tag>Bot), so the check for a real task left
  behind looks for, stops and removes only this run's; its ports are held by a
  lock file for the whole run, so a second copy cannot pick the same ones; and
  its folders are under a scratch folder of its own, as they were.

  And issue #2113: Deploy-DevGamemode sends a gamemode only onto the server
  build its commit records (#2076), so the scratch commit holds this
  repository's records\server-build.json and the stand-in dev box holds the
  same record, as a full dev publish leaves it. Without them every dev case
  was refused at that check and none reached the swap. A dev box that holds
  another build's record is refused before anything is sent.

  Connects to nothing but 127.0.0.1.
