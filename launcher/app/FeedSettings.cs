    /// VERSION.JSON IN TWO (#1050, Patrick's answer of 19 Oct). The launcher
    /// reads the feed on every check, every thirty seconds while the game
    /// runs, and on 19 Oct main's was 4,928 bytes of which almost nothing
    /// changes between releases. So the publisher can keep in version.json
    /// only what the update check itself needs (the launcher's version,
    /// address and sha256, minLauncher, the release record and the news file)
    /// and put every other field, the server and voice addresses, Discord, the
    /// Skyrim pin, the client runtime, the signed manifest, into one asset
    /// named by its sha256, "settings": { sha256 }. Every asset the feed names
    /// is named by its sha256 alone, and its address is the feed's own assets
    /// folder plus that (VersionDoc.ParseFeed with AssetsOf).
    ///
    /// The settings file is a feed itself, every field but the update ones,
    /// so VersionDoc.Join puts the two together and nothing that reads a
    /// VersionDoc needs to know which file a field came from. It is fetched
    /// only when its sha256 is not the one in memory or in
    /// Profile\feed-settings.json, so a check whose settings did not move
    /// downloads version.json alone.
    ///
    /// Not cosmetic like the news file: a feed that names settings this
    /// launcher cannot have is a feed it cannot read, and the check fails
    /// with the reason, the way an unreadable version.json does. Every
    /// launcher before this reads only version.json, which is why the
    /// publisher splits it only once the channel's minLauncher reads the file
    /// (Feed-Json.ps1, $FeedSplitLauncher). Those launchers are below
    /// minLauncher then, and version.json still gives them what they need to
    /// update themselves: the launcher fields, and "packs" and "news" as the
    /// empty lists they have always read.
