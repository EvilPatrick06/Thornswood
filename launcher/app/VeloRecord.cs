    /// manifest.json, the name and sha256 of each of its files, and

    /// ThornswoodRelease on GitHub's runner, from main's own workflow only
    /// (scripts/release/New-SignedManifest.ps1, Sign-OnRunner.ps1). A file
    /// that manifest lists was released by someone holding the signing right.
    ///
    /// The Release a package belongs to is named by its version: one time and
    /// one run number give both (scripts/release/MergeRelease.ps1,
    /// New-MergeReleaseNames), version yyyy.(month*100+day).run and tag
    /// build-yyyyMMdd.run. So the record is fetched from that tag whichever
    /// Release served the package. Main's package of the same version (the
    /// part "main", packed beside dev's and listed in the same record) is
    /// published from a Release of its own once Patrick approves it (#5181),
    /// and is held to the record the merge release signed.
