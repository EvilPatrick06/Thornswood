    /// (scripts/release/New-SignedManifest.ps1, Sign-OnRunner.ps1). A file
    /// that manifest lists was released by someone holding the signing right.
    ///
    /// The Release a package belongs to is named by its version: one time and
    /// one run number give both (scripts/release/MergeRelease.ps1,
    /// New-MergeReleaseNames), version yyyy.(month*100+day).run and tag
    /// build-yyyyMMdd.run. So the record is fetched from that tag whichever
    /// Release served the package, which is what lets main serve the same
    /// bytes from a Release of its own (#5181) and still be held to the
    /// record dev's Release was signed with.
