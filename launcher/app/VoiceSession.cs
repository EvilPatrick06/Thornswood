          Whisper, local and yell, and why the level is worked out here rather
          than left to the panner.

          The three modes used to set panner.maxDistance and nothing else, and
          all three sounded identical because WebAudio's inverse distance model
          never reads maxDistance. Only the linear model does. So every voice in
          the world carried the same distance whichever mode the speaker was in,
          and changing mode moved a number nothing looked at.

          Linear is the model that would have honoured it, and it is the wrong
          shape for a voice: the volume falls at a fixed rate and then stops
          dead. So the panner places the voice and applies no distance
          attenuation of its own (rolloffFactor 0 makes the inverse model
          return 1 at every distance, VoiceMix.DistanceGain), and the level is
          worked out below from the speaker's mode.

          Three numbers per mode, metres except the last:

            full   inside this you hear them at the mode's own level
            quiet  by this you hear nothing, and between the two it fades
            level  how loud the mode is at all, because a yell across a square
                   is louder than a whisper in your ear and not only further

          Brought in on 19 September, heard in game rather than worked out here:
          the first set carried too far in all three. Whisper is cut to a third
          of what it was, local and yell to two thirds, which is what Djinn
          asked for after listening to it. The levels are untouched; it was the
          distance that was wrong, not the loudness.

          Local halved again on 20 September, asked for by Patrick after hearing
          the 19 September set in game: 2.7 and 12 become 1.35 and 6. Whisper
          and yell are left where they are, so the three modes separate more
          sharply than they did, which is the point of having three.

          Skyrim is 70 units to the metre, so a whisper dies by about 120
          units, local by about 420 and a yell by about 2100.

          HOW SOON TO TRY AGAIN, AND HOW TO TELL THE SERVER IS GONE. Issues
          #409, #519.

          On 21 September the voice page opened the socket 592 times, every two
          seconds, and launcher.log has both halves of why. From 19:09 the
          Wi-Fi was down and the machine slept at 19:39: 425 tries that never
          opened. It woke at 20:06 holding a join token from 19:02, which had
          expired at 20:02; the service refused it and closed, and the page
          never read the refusal, so it came straight back with the same token
          every two seconds: 134 tries that opened and were shut in the same
          second, until the launcher's own renewal got through at 20:11. A two
          second retry has no reason to stop.

          So each try waits longer than the one before, from two seconds to a
          minute, and never exactly as long as anybody else's, so a service
          restart does not bring every launcher back in the same instant. It
          goes back to two seconds only once the service has let us in.

          And every try has a token of its own (#1322). A token opens one
          connection and the service refuses a handshake without one (#1337),
          so each try asks the launcher for a fresh one ('token') and spends it
          on that try, whatever comes of it. A refused handshake looks here
          like any other lost connection, so the backoff is what holds it down;
          the launcher always answers, and an empty answer waits for the clock.

          And voice listens for the server. A WebSocket's own pings are
          answered without anybody seeing them, so a socket that went half open
          during a sleep or a change of network looked exactly like a quiet
          room. Every twenty five seconds this sends { t: 'ping' }, the service
          answers { t: 'pong' }, and seventy seconds with nothing at all from
          it is a lost connection, dealt with like any other.
