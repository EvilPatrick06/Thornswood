    /// What is checked, in order, before an update is applied:
    ///   1. Velopack checks every package it downloads against the sha256 its
    ///      channel's feed names (releases.&lt;channel&gt;.json on the Release).
    ///   2. That sha256 must be the one the Release's signed record lists for
    ///      that file (VeloRecord.Vouches), checked in Velopack's own checksum
    ///      step, so a package nobody signed for is refused before Velopack
    ///      keeps it or takes its Update.exe out of it.
    ///   3. Every file in the package, however it was put together (whole, or
    ///      rebuilt from the version before and its deltas): each game file by
    ///      size and sha256 against the signed game-files.json, each program
    ///      by Signature.Refusal (VeloPackage.cs).
    ///   4. The Update.exe Velopack took out of the package, by Signature.Refusal,
    ///      since it is what applies the update.
    /// A refusal deletes the package and says which check it failed; the
    /// launcher that is running is untouched.
