    // The character list, and what actually keeps characters apart is the
    // profile id.
    //
    // Under SkyMP a character is not a save file. It is a change form held by
    // the server, and which one you get is decided by gameData.profileId in
    // skymp5-client-settings.txt: connect on profile 1 and the server hands
    // back profile 1's body, inventory and face, whatever Skyrim's own menu
    // says. That is why New Game never produced a new character.
    //
    // Until 20 September the launcher chose the id. Play opened a bar with two
    // slots, each slot owned an id, and a slot's button wrote that id into the
    // client settings before the game started; an empty slot took an id nobody
    // had used and a trade and town dialog ran first. All of that is gone.
    // Play means Play: the person picks their character at the game's own
    // main menu, which our plugin draws from a file this class writes
    // (Data\Platform\thornswood-characters.json) and answers with one line in
    // Data\Platform\thornswood-choice.txt, which Shell polls while the game
    // runs. The client settings carry chooseAtMenu = true and the id played
    // last, so the client waits at the menu rather than connecting as anybody.
    //
    // What stays here is the list itself, profiles.txt: one row per id this
    // install has played, plus one spare row on slot 0 holding the id the
    // menu's New character will use, minted under the Discord account the
    // install is linked to. Ids are never reused inside one install.
    //
    // The save folder is still redirected, to one folder for the whole install
    // rather than one per slot. SkyrimPlatform writes its own .ess as it works
    // and there is no reason for them to land among somebody's own saves.
