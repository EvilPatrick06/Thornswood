    /// Skyrim's own archives in Thornswood's folder, kept on the disk once
    /// (#1217) without Thornswood depending on the Steam copy (#1218), and
    /// 1.6.1170's own files put into the folder by the Downgrade.
    ///
    /// THE QUESTION. Thornswood\Game and the Steam copy both hold Skyrim's
    /// archives, 15 GB of them. A hard link keeps them on the disk once, but a
    /// hard link is one file under two names, and the Steam copy is the
    /// person's to update, verify and mod however they like (Patrick,
    /// 29 Sep). So what does each of those do to a file linked from here?
    ///
    /// MEASURED, 29 September, on the shipping machine:
    ///   - Steam never writes an update or a repair into a file in place.
    ///     Every update in both content logs stages whole files under
    ///     steamapps\downloading\app and moves them in: stage totals equal the
    ///     full size of the files changed, delta updates included (Echoes of
    ///     Aincrad: download 4.7 GB and reuse 3.9 GB, stage 8.85 GB, commit of
    ///     10 files in the same second). A move puts a new file under the
    ///     Steam copy's name and leaves the file linked from here as it was.
    ///     Vortex replaces a file by renaming the old one to .vortex_backup,
    ///     which leaves it as it was too.
    ///   - A file copied over the Steam copy's DOES reach here. Of nine ways
    ///     of putting new bytes at a path with a second name linked to it,
    ///     rename, File.Replace and Move-Item left the second name on the old
    ///     bytes; .NET File.Copy with overwrite, PowerShell Copy-Item, cmd
    ///     copy /y, xcopy /y, robocopy and a patcher writing in place all
    ///     changed it. Copying files over the game is how manual mods and
    ///     other launchers' downgrades go in.
    ///   - NTFS's change time of the file moves on every one of those writes,
    ///     even when the writer puts the last-write time back, and on a name
    ///     being added or removed; reading it and holding it open do not move
    ///     it. So the change time says for certain whether the bytes can have
    ///     changed, without reading them.
    ///   - On the shipping machine 18 of the folder's archives, 13.2 GB, were
    ///     copies of their own (on record as links) and all 18 had the same
    ///     bytes as the Steam copy's. SHA-256 read them at 492 MB/s, so all of
    ///     the archives take about 30 seconds: too long for every Play, fine
    ///     once in a while.
    ///
    /// SO: an archive is linked to the Steam copy's only when the two hold the
    /// same bytes (Share), with its SHA-256, file id, size and change time on
    /// record. Before every Play (CheckShared) each linked archive's change
    /// time is read; one that moved is hashed, and one whose bytes are no
    /// longer the recorded ones is never played on. The bytes are gone from
    /// the disk then, because the one file was written, so the Downgrade
    /// fetches 1.6.1170's own files from Steam again and the folder takes a
    /// copy of its own (TakePinned). A Steam update or verify never costs
    /// that; only a file copied over the Steam copy's archive does, and then
    /// Thornswood stops and says so rather than play on the wrong bytes.
    /// Nothing here ever writes into the Steam copy.
