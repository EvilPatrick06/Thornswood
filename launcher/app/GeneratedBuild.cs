    /// <summary>
    /// Builds Thornswood's animation and body files (Pandora Behaviour Engine+'s
    /// behavior files and BodySlide's bodies) in a Thornswood game folder, and
    /// records them (Generated.cs). Issue #1247, and since 27 Oct 2026 #3715:
    /// the launcher runs this on each computer (GeneratedHere.cs) instead of a
    /// release carrying what the shipping machine built, because what Pandora
    /// and BodySlide make is the game's graphs and other people's bodies, which
    /// Thornswood has no right to hand on (THIRD-PARTY.md). Never writes into
    /// the Steam copy.
    ///
    /// WHY PANDORA AND NOT NEMESIS. Measured 29 Sep on the shipping machine:
    /// Nemesis -generate sat for seven minutes on 0.09 s of processor time,
    /// with no window and no file written. In its own source, v0.84 and since,
    /// -generate connects its worker to a slot named GenerateBehavior(), which
    /// does not exist (the slot is InitializeGeneration()), so no Nemesis
    /// release can generate from a command line. Pandora Behaviour Engine+
    /// reads the same patches, runs from a command line (--auto_run
    /// --auto_close), and was compared with Nemesis' output the same day: the
    /// same 20 behavior and character files with the same names in them. The
    /// collection carries Pandora from revision 2 (docs\COLLECTION-REVISION-2.md).
    ///
    /// WHAT IT DOES, in &lt;Root&gt;\Game:
    ///   1. Refuses while anything has the folder open (InUse), when the folder
    ///      is not one the launcher made, and when it could be the Steam copy
    ///      or any folder Vortex deploys into.
    ///   2. Checks the build list: Pandora and the patches are in this folder,
    ///      and every BodySlide set it names keeps to the body rules. Each set
    ///      is built at its own slider defaults, written out as a preset that
    ///      names every slider, and nothing that shapes the breasts, the seat,
    ///      the genitals or the nipples may do anything (issue #1004), no zap
    ///      may take the underwear off (issue #405), and no RaceMenu morph file
    ///      is built (BodySlide is never given --trimorphs).
    ///   3. Gives the folder its own copy of every file BodySlide writes in
    ///      place (its settings, its presets and groups). The folder holds most
    ///      of the collection as hard links to Vortex's copies, and a file
    ///      written through a link is written in Vortex's copy and the Steam
    ///      copy too.
    ///   4. Pandora: runs a copy of it in the work folder, never the one in the
    ///      game folder: its own folder, or, where Vortex deployed it loose into
    ///      Data, the files Vortex's record lists for its mod. Its Settings.json
    ///      names this folder's Data and a work output folder and nothing else:
    ///      Pandora reads its folders from there, not from -o (v4.4.0 parses -o
    ///      and never uses it), and without it falls back to the registry's
    ///      Skyrim, the Steam copy. Its ActiveMods.json turns on exactly the
    ///      patches the list names and every other patch off. It refuses if
    ///      Pandora changed anything in the game folder, if its log has an
    ///      error or names other patches, then puts each file it made in place
    ///      as a new file of this folder's own, in the letter case the folder
    ///      already uses.
    ///   5. BodySlide: sets it to Skyrim Special Edition and this folder's Data,
    ///      builds each set into a folder of its own (--targetdir), reads the
    ///      bodies it built (CoveredBodies) and refuses a nude one, then puts
    ///      each file in place as a new file of this folder's own.
    ///   6. Refuses, and records nothing, if any file the tools changed is
    ///      shared with another folder (written through a link), or if
    ///      BodySlide wrote anywhere but where it was told.
    ///   7. Files the last build made that this one did not are put back:
    ///      Vortex's own copy where Vortex deploys that path, otherwise taken
    ///      out.
    ///   8. Reads every body in the folder, the built ones and any a mod
    ///      brought, and records nothing while one is nude (#405).
    ///   9. Writes Profile\OwnGame\generated.txt: each file it made, with its
    ///      sha256, and what it was built from. The launcher keeps those files
    ///      as Thornswood's (OwnGameKinds.cs), and nothing ships them
