    /// copy by hand (loose meshes, textures, script extender plugins, their
    /// own .esp) stay out, because people play vanilla Skyrim from Steam with
    /// their own mods and Thornswood runs from its own folder.
    ///
    /// Until then Make walked the whole Steam copy and took every file Skip
    /// did not name, so a hand placed mod there became part of Thornswood's
    /// folder and loaded in Thornswood's sessions, and Publish-Update shipped
    /// it from the shipping machine to everybody.

    /// SKYRIM'S OWN is a real list, never a guess by folder: every file of the
    /// three depots the pin names (records\skyrim-pin.json), read out of
    /// Steam's own manifests of them by scripts\release\New-SkyrimFilesRecord.ps1
    /// into records\skyrim-files.json, which Build-Launcher puts inside the
    /// launcher. Those manifests are what the Downgrade asks Steam for, so the
