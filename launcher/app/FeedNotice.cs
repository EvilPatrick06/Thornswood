    /// start, and all the launcher ever did with it was write one line into the
    /// log, where it scrolled away. So on the day Steam, Nexus or Discord
    /// changes something under everybody there was nowhere to say so that a
    /// person would actually see, and no way to stop people launching into it.
    ///
    /// Three fields in version.json, all optional and all set by hand in the
    /// releases repo, because no script writes them:
    ///
    ///   message       one or two sentences for everybody, shown in a bar
    ///                 above Play until a feed without it arrives. On its own
    ///                 it never holds Play.
    ///   maintenance   true holds Play, with the message as the reason.
    ///   minLauncher   a launcher older than this version holds Play.
    ///
    /// Pure on purpose: it takes the document and the running version and
    /// says what to show, so tests\test-feed-notice.ps1 compiles this file
    /// with Config.cs and asks it every case without a window.

    /// never read, a field missing from an older feed, a minimum that is not a
    /// version number, a maintenance value that is not plainly on: each of
