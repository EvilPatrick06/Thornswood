    /// by hand or from a launcher that is out of date. Now it ends any session
    /// that has not shown it a pass the site signed.

    /// When a character is picked at the game's menu (Shell.PollChoice), this
    /// asks the site for a pass for that character (Discord.Pass) and leaves it
    /// in Game\Data\Platform\thornswood-pass.txt, where the front plugin reads
    /// it and sends it to the game server. A pass is good for ten minutes, but
    /// the game server lets it prove one session only, and start one only in
    /// the minute and a half after the site issued it (#1320), so it is
    /// fetched again every minute while the game runs: a session that
    /// reconnects after a server restart, or after its connection dropped, has
    /// a pass it has not used within the minute. A fetch that fails is tried
    /// again a minute later, and the site's reason goes in the log and on the
    /// status line once. The pass itself never goes in a log.

    /// can still reach the feed and update itself.
