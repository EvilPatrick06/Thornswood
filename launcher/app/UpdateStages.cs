    /// reads to tell Thornswood's files from Vortex's (Profile\Packs, Keep,
    /// release.txt's synced line, release-files.txt). So it runs beside a
    /// refresh. WriteUpdate is the second half, and the caller runs it under
    /// OwnGame.Alone, so it waits for a refresh under way and no refresh
    /// starts writing while it does: both keep records of the folder, and one
    /// changing them under the other would leave either record wrong.
