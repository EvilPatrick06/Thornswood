    /// The launcher as Windows Settings opens it, from Uninstall under
    /// Installed apps.
    ///
    /// That button runs the exe with -uninstall, which is what Register.cs
    /// writes as UninstallString. Until 24 September the switch changed one
    /// thing, the page the window opened on, and everything else ran as if the
    /// person had opened the launcher to play: the update check, the server
    /// scan and the ping every half minute, the client repair that can
    /// download into the very game folder about to be deleted, voice, the
    /// Installed apps entry written again on the way out, the last session's
    /// logs sent, the game's INI files corrected, the own game folder offered
    /// or brought up to date, and the theme playing. All of it before the
    /// person reached the one button they came for, at the bottom of a page
    /// they then had to scroll. The To Do List put it as "Somebody who pressed
    /// Uninstall in Windows Settings should not watch a launcher start up and
    /// check for updates".
    ///
    /// It is still the real window, on the Settings page, and not a small
    /// window of its own. DoUninstall reads the two ticks and the button
    /// straight off that page with no null guard, so any other window throws
    /// on its first line. And the reason Settings opens the launcher at all,
    /// written above UninstallString in Register.cs, is that the uninstall
    /// asks two questions that matter and puts the Windows Skyrim folders back
    /// before it deletes anything. Both questions and that order live in
    /// DoUninstall and Uninstall.Begin, and neither is touched here.
    ///
    /// So Run parses the window, binds it, wires it and draws the Settings
    /// page and its folder rows, then comes here instead of going on. Two
    /// things Wire starts are stood down below before the window's message
    /// loop has run once, so neither ever fires: the two second timer, which
    /// pings the server and watches for the game, and the own game folder
    /// check on first draw. Wire skips the voice service's health probe and
    /// StartMenuMusic skips the theme, both on askedToUninstall. Play stays
    /// shut, because nothing has said this build is current, which is where
    /// updatePending starts.
    ///
    /// tests\test-uninstall-entry.js walks everything this path can reach and
    /// fails if any of that startup work comes back into it.
