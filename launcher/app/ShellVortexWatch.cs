    /// Patrick, 31 Oct, on his dev install: "after updating to collection
    /// version 6 I had to click in the diagnasotics page and manually click
    /// scan and fix the app didnt catch automatically that I had updated to
    /// revision 6". Two things were missing, and both had to be there:
    ///
    ///   1. Nothing looked at Vortex again. DrawStatus reads the installed
    ///      revision fresh, but only runs on a page change, a scan, a feed
    ///      answer or Steam starting and stopping. Somebody who pressed
    ///      "Open revision N", updated in Vortex and came back to the Play
    ///      page touched none of those, so the card said the mods needed
    ///      updating long after they did not.
    ///   2. The updates that waited on the collection were never asked for
    ///      again. OnVersionDoc returns early while ModsMissing, with no mod
    ///      updates pending, so even a redraw that took the card down left
    ///      the release built on the new revision uninstalled and Play open
    ///      on the old one. Only Scan, which hands its feed answer back to
    ///      OnVersionDoc, ever put that right.
    ///
    /// So while the collection card or the not-confirmed note is up, the two
    /// second tick compares what Vortex has on disk (its state.v2 files and
    /// the plugin list, by name, size and write time, which is a directory
    /// listing and nothing more). Only when that changes is the revision read
    /// again, off the UI thread, because the read walks Vortex's whole state
    /// database. When the answer differs from what the card was drawn from,
    /// the card is drawn again; when the card comes down, the feed is asked
    /// again the same way the start and Scan ask it, with Play shut on
    /// CHECKING until it answers, so the waiting updates are offered, and go
    /// in by themselves when automatic updates are on.
    ///
    /// Every later change Vortex writes is looked at the same way, so the
    /// card follows Vortex to where it stops. Play's own gates (Verify, and
    /// OwnGameRefreshIfDue for Thornswood's own folder) still judge the
    /// folder Vortex left, as they always have.
    ///
    /// Since #5200 the card's button opens Vortex itself at the server's
    /// revision (Shell.OpenCollection), and when the card comes down here
