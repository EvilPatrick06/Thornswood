    /// Steam's Updates setting for Skyrim: read on every start so the log says
    /// what it is, and set to "Wait until I launch the game" by the launcher
    /// itself, with Steam closed (see "SO THE LAUNCHER WRITES THE SETTING
    /// ITSELF" below).
    ///
    /// Why it matters. The downgrade puts the 1.6.1170 files in place, but
    /// Steam still believes the game is on the newest build, and unless the
    /// setting tells it to wait for a launch, the next Skyrim update Steam
    /// takes by itself undoes the whole downgrade with nobody pressing
    /// anything. Until this, the only protection was a line in the log asking
    /// people not to start Skyrim through Steam.
    ///
    /// The setting lives in Steam's own file for the game,
    /// steamapps\appmanifest_489830.acf in the library that holds Skyrim, as
    /// "AutoUpdateBehavior". In Steam it is the Automatic Updates list on the
    /// game's Properties, Updates page: 0 is "Use global setting" (whatever
    /// Settings, Downloads says for every game), 1 is "Wait until I launch the
    /// game", 2 is "Immediately download updates", 3 is "Let Steam decide when
    /// to update". 1 is what picking "Wait until I launch the game" writes, and
    /// what every downgrade guide sets. It is a mitigation, not a lock: Steam
    /// still updates the game when it is started from Steam, which is what the
    /// downgrade's last log line already asks people not to do.
    ///
    /// Those names and numbers are read off the installed Steam, not from
    /// memory, because Steam has renamed them. The first version of this class
    /// told people to pick "Only update this game when I launch it", and a
    /// review found that no such choice is in Steam any more. On Patrick's
    /// machine on 24 September, steamui\localization\steamui_english-json.js
    /// (8 August) holds the four names above, neither old name is anywhere
    /// under steamui or resource, and the UI bundle, steamui\chunk~2dcc5aaf7.js,
    /// gives use global 0, wait for launch 1, immediately 2 and let Steam
    /// decide 3. test-steam-updates.ps1 checks the names and numbers against
    /// the installed Steam wherever there is one.
    ///
    /// Measured on Patrick's machine on 24 September, read only: the file is
    /// 1156 bytes of Valve's KeyValues text, tab separated, LF line endings,
    /// with "AutoUpdateBehavior" "0". It also carries the ReadOnly attribute,
    /// the only one of twenty manifests there that does, which is what some
    /// downgrade guides tell people to do. Steam was running at the time.
    ///
    /// READ ONLY IS NOT HOW THE VERSION IS HELD (issue #493). Steam keeps
    /// this file up to date with the game's state and writes it every few
    /// seconds while it runs; a read-only file makes every one of those
    /// writes fail. On Patrick's machine on 29 September Steam's
    /// logs\content_log.txt held 11,568 lines of "Failed to write app state
    /// file ... appmanifest_489830.acf (1156 bytes)", one every six seconds,
    /// and nothing else Steam logs about Skyrim is findable among them. The
    /// mark went on by hand or by another program on 10 September, before
    /// any of this repository's tooling existed (nothing in its history sets
    /// it). Until #493 Hold then put it back after every write, so the
    /// launcher kept it there. The version is held by the setting above,
    /// which is Steam's own way to hold it and survives Steam's writes, and
    /// by starting Skyrim from the launcher. So Hold takes the mark off, and
    /// the start line says when a file has it and how to take it off by hand.
    ///
    /// WHAT THE MARK WAS GUARDING, measured on Patrick's machine on
    /// 29 September, read only, when he asked whether it should stay read only
    /// so Steam does not update the game:
    ///   - Thornswood does not run the Steam copy. It runs Thornswood\Game
    ///     (OwnGame), and that folder's SkyrimSE.exe, masters and every file
    ///     in the game's root are its own copies: fsutil gives them other file
    ///     ids than the Steam copy's. Of the Steam copy's files in the root and
    ///     in Data, 27 share a file with Thornswood's folder, and the only ones
    ///     that are the game's own are five archives (_ResourcePack.bsa and
    ///     four Creation Club ones); the rest are mods Vortex deployed.
    ///   - Steam never writes an update into a file in place. It builds each
    ///     changed file whole under steamapps\downloading\<app> and then moves
    ///     it into the game folder: content_log.txt on 25 September has
    ///     Echoes of Aincrad stage 8,850,941,379 bytes and "starting commit
    ///     from ...\downloading\2244210 ... 10 updated" finish in the same
    ///     second, which only a move can do. A move puts a new file under the
    ///     Steam copy's name and leaves the file Thornswood's folder links to
    ///     as it was. So a Steam update cannot reach the game Thornswood runs,
    ///     and Play still checks that folder's exe (Checks "Game build").
    ///   - What an update cost was the Steam copy: Thornswood's folder was
    ///     brought up to date from it, OwnGame.WhyNot refused while it was on
    ///     another build, and the Downgrade had to be run again. Since #1218 a
    ///     folder that is made takes nothing but Vortex's files and never
    ///     reads the Steam copy's game, so an update costs it nothing. The
    ///     setting still saves a download before the folder is made, when
    ///     the folder is made from the Steam copy only if that copy is on
    ///     1.6.1170.
    ///   - The mark itself was never put to the test. Steam's file says it
    ///     holds build 24914197, taken on 10 September 11:06 (lastupdated),
    ///     two hours before the mark went on, and neither content log has an
    ///     "Update Required" for 489830: there has been no newer Skyrim since.
    ///     What it did do is 43,739 "Failed to write app state file" lines in
    ///     the two logs, and it would stop Steam saving this very setting if it
    ///     were changed on Steam's Properties page.
    ///
    /// SO THE LAUNCHER WRITES THE SETTING ITSELF (Patrick on #493, 29 Sep:
    /// "Our Repo should write this so it doesn't auto update the game and
    /// people have to re do the downgrade again"). At every start until
    /// Thornswood's own folder is made (LooksAtStart, #1226), while the
    /// Steam copy is on the build the server runs and the file is not on 1 or
    /// carries the mark (OnStart): with Steam closed it is written there and
    /// then, with nothing to ask; with Steam open, a question whose Yes closes
    /// Steam, writes it, and starts Steam again, and a No that is remembered.
    /// It no longer follows a downgrade: the downgrade does not write the
    /// Steam copy any more (#1218), so there is nothing there to hold.
    ///
    /// So the write:
    ///   - never while Steam is running. Steam keeps the setting in memory and
    ///     writes its own copy of the file when it closes, which undoes an edit
    ///     made underneath it without a sign;
    ///   - changes the bytes of that one value and nothing else, read and
    ///     written byte for byte, because a manifest Steam cannot parse is a
    ///     much worse failure than an unwanted update. Anything not laid out
    ///     the way Steam writes it is left alone;
    ///   - goes through a temporary file, flushed to the disk and renamed over
    ///     the manifest in one call (MoveFileEx, MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING), so
    ///     the manifest is the old one or the new one whole and never missing.
    ///     Not File.Replace (#2591): it moves the old manifest aside first, so
    ///     a launcher stopped inside it left no manifest at all, which Steam
    ///     reads as Skyrim not being installed. Measured 16 Oct on One: a
