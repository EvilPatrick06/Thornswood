    /// Crash Logger writes a text log for every crash: a scan of the stack
    /// and its best guess at the module. For the rare crashes that is not
    /// enough to find the cause (#407, where frame 0 is the bad address
    /// itself, and #408). Crash Logger can also write a snapshot beside the
    /// log, crash-(time).dmp, holding all of the game's memory at that moment
    /// (it asks Windows for MiniDumpWithFullMemory), which a debugger opens
    /// as if the crash were happening in front of it.
    ///
    /// WHY IT IS OFF UNLESS ASKED FOR. Until 17 October this was turned on
    /// by itself for the dev build and for every staff Discord account, and
    /// the comment here said one was "about 1 GB". The one written on Djinn's
    /// PC that day was 9,829,847,602 bytes and took about 95 seconds, and
    /// nobody had told him it was being written. His words: "filling my PC
    /// with information I knew nothing about taking up space and resources is
    /// not cool". So it is a setting, Settings, Crash snapshots, off for
    /// everybody until they tick it, with the size said beside the box and a
    /// folder they choose.
    ///
    /// Before every Play, Apply writes Crash Logger's own switch into this
    /// install's CrashLogger.ini to match the setting. Turning it off stops
    /// new snapshots and deletes nothing: a file already on somebody's disk
    /// is theirs to keep or delete.
    ///
    /// KEPT UNTIL LOOKED AT, TWO AT MOST (#2319, decided by Patrick on 12
    /// Oct). Until then only the newest was kept, so the next crash deleted
    /// the one before it whether anybody had read it or not: none of the four
    /// written between 29 Sep and 6 Oct was read. Now each snapshot is tied
    /// to the session it crashed in (Remember, from the session logs), staff
    /// mark that crash looked at on the sessions page, the site says so in

    /// deletes a snapshot only once its crash is marked, or when it is the
    /// third. Crash Logger's own Max Minidumps is held at the same two. The
    /// setting says all of this before it is ticked.
    ///
    /// As the game closes after a crash, AfterSession moves the snapshot to
    /// the chosen folder when there is one, and the launcher shows it with
    /// its size and asks whether to keep it (Shell.cs).
