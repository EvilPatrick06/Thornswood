    /// Patrick, 29 Sep: "it should only do that if you choose own folder
    /// during install; otherwise it still uses Steam's copy until you turn own
    /// game folder on later, then it should make the own game folder and do
    /// the clean up; for people that already have the game folder, have the
    /// next update do this for them." An install that chose its own folder in
    /// the setup window never wrote into the Steam copy (Paths.OwnFirst). One
    /// that did not wrote Thornswood's files there, as every install before
    /// it did, and once its folder is made those files are the folder's and
    /// have no business in the Steam copy, where a vanilla game started from
    /// Steam would load Thornswood's client and content.
    ///
    /// So the first start that finds the folder made takes them out, once:
    /// the files the installer put there and the ones packs added after it
    /// (Profile\installed-into-game.txt, the list Uninstall works from), and
    /// the files the launcher itself names as Thornswood's (Thornswood.ini and
    /// the thornswood- notes and scripts under Data\Platform). Nothing that
    /// Vortex's record lists, nothing of Bethesda's, and nothing anybody else
    /// put there. Where another SkyMP server's launcher writes the same path
    /// (the client runtime and the client's page), a file goes only when its
    /// bytes are Thornswood's: the recorded client build, or the copy Keep
    /// holds of what an update wrote. The client's settings file, which every
