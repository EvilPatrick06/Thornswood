    /// malebody_0.nif and _1.nif), and every actor of that sex wears it under
    /// whatever they have on: people, NPCs, a body on the ground after it has
    /// been looted, and the figure in the race menu. So the underwear has to be
    /// part of that mesh. Vanilla Skyrim's are: FemaleUnderwear and
    /// MaleUnderwear_1 are shapes inside the stock meshes. A body replacer that
    /// leaves them out makes everybody of that sex nude the moment their
    /// clothes come off.
    ///
    /// MEASURED 28 SEP on the shipping machine: the female body the collection
    /// deploys is CBBE 3BA 2.48's prebuilt mesh, shapes 3BA, 3BA_Vagina and
    /// 3BA_Anus with no Bra or Panty, and the male body is HIMBO V5's

    ///   the top (Bra, a top, or a one-piece Underwear) and one for the bottom
    ///   (Panty, Underwear, briefs, a loincloth).
    /// - Astrid's burned body (femalebodyastrid_0/_1, one NPC, after one Dark
    ///   Brotherhood scene) is charred skin with no underwear even in Skyrim's
    ///   own mesh, so it is listed on its own line and fails only when it
    ///   carries a genital shape.
    /// - A man's body (malebody_0/_1) is covered when it has a shape for the
    ///   bottom (Boxers, Underwear, briefs, a loincloth).
    /// - A body that is not loose in Data comes from the game's own archive,
    ///   and Skyrim's own bodies are covered.
    /// - Any other mesh under meshes\actors\character with a genital shape in
