    /// Thornswood's own Skyrim folder, Root\Game, made from whatever Vortex has
    /// deployed while the Thornswood collection is the profile it has on.
    ///
    /// Until 17 September three roleplay servers all ran out of the one
    /// Steam copy of Skyrim. Every launcher wrote its own client into it, every
    /// Vortex profile switch took the other collection out of it, and on 16 Sep
    /// that was a another server session drawing Thornswood's menu, a Daedric menu
    /// behind every server, and a Thornswood launcher that thought its mods were
    /// gone whenever Vortex had another profile on. With a folder of its own,
    /// Thornswood starts from Root\Game, the other servers start from theirs,
    /// and switching the profile in Vortex no longer reaches Thornswood at all.
    ///
    /// The folder is made of hard links, not copies, so the collection is not
    /// on the disk twice. A hard link is the same file under a second name, so
    /// anything written into a linked file in place would land in Vortex's copy
    /// and in every other folder that links it. The game and the mods rewrite
    /// their settings files all the time, and every launcher rewrites its
    /// client. So those are copied and only the big files nothing writes to are
    /// linked: archives, textures, meshes, sounds, plugins. What this launcher
    /// itself writes over goes through Unshare or Separate first.
    ///
    /// Paths.Init already picks Root\Game over the Steam copy when it exists;
    /// that is the layout installs had before the collection. The difference is
    /// only where the files came from, recorded in Profile\OwnGame.
    ///
    /// ONCE MADE, THE FOLDER NEEDS NOTHING FROM THE STEAM COPY (#1218).
    /// Patrick, 29 Sep: "it shouldn't be using Steam's now anyway, but this
    /// way people can play vanilla at whatever version and their own mods".
    /// The Steam copy is the person's: they may update it, verify it and mod
    /// it however they like. So it is read once, when the folder is first
    /// made (Make), and only if it is on 1.6.1170; when it is on another
    /// build the Downgrade downloads 1.6.1170's own files from Steam and the
    /// folder is made from those instead. From then on the folder holds the
    /// game itself, a refresh takes nothing but Vortex's deployment (Vortex),
    /// the game's own files are the folder's own copies, and nothing here
    /// writes into the Steam copy. Skyrim's archives are the one thing still
    /// kept on the disk once, and only while their bytes are the same as the
    /// folder's own record; OwnGameShare.cs checks that before every Play.

              A LOOSE map.swf, WHICH IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S AND BREAKS SkyUI.

              22 September: a full screen box on the way in, "SKYUI ERROR CODE
              5. Incompatible menu file (map.swf)." SkyUI checks that file's
              version and refuses one it does not recognise, so the box is
              SkyUI saying something else's copy won.

              MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED. The file is in the Steam copy, this
              class hard linked it into Thornswood's folder, and the publish
              baseline ships it. Vortex's own deployment record does NOT list
              it: nothing in the collection put it there. SkyUI ships its
              map.swf inside SkyUI_SE.bsa, and A Quality World Map, which is
              the other mod anybody would suspect, ships 32 files and not one
              of them is a .swf or anything under Interface at all. Its map is
              Textures\terrain\*.dds, the ESP and two scripts.

              So the loose file is an orphan another launcher left in the Steam
              copy, it overrides SkyUI's copy because loose beats an archive,
              and it is the only reason for the error.

              TAKING IT OUT LOSES NOTHING AND KEEPS THE GOOD MAP. SkyUI's own
              copy loads from its archive, and A Quality World Map's terrain
              textures are untouched, so the map still looks the way Patrick
              wants it to.

              This is the same disease as the SkyMP client runtime above, in a
              different folder: a file in the Steam copy that is not the
              collection's, taken into our folder and then shipped to everybody
              as though it were ours. Ship-Rules.ps1 carries the same rule;
              change the two together.
