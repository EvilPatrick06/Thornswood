                SAID EVERY START, not once, and said before anything is offered.

                The offer below is made once and can be declined, and after that
                nothing ever mentioned it again. So somebody who said no in
                September is still sharing one Skyrim with every other server on
                their machine months later, with nothing anywhere saying so.

                WHAT SHARING ACTUALLY COSTS, and it is not obvious from the
                outside. Data\Platform\Plugins\skymp5-client-settings.txt is ONE
                FILE in the Steam copy. Every launcher on the machine writes it
                and the game reads whichever wrote last. Ours puts chooseAtMenu
                and a profile id in it on every Play; another server's puts its
                own settings there. Start the game after theirs and our plugin
                sees no chooseAtMenu, does nothing, and the stock SkyMP login box
                comes up reading ID: UNDEFINED. Reported 21 September by a tester
                who plays two other servers, WITH OUR BACKDROP BEHIND IT, which
                is what makes it so hard to read: Vortex deployed our collection
                into that same shared copy, so the art, the menu and the mods are
                all ours and correct while the one file that decides who you are
                belongs to somebody else. My Games and LocalAppData are shared
                the same way, because Swap.Apply stands down in this mode and
                leaves Vortex to own them.

                This line is what lets the next report be read in ten seconds
                instead of an evening. It goes to the log on the window's thread,
                before the pool work below, because Log writes a WPF object.
