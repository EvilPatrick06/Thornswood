# Thornswood

Thornswood is a roleplay server for Skyrim Special Edition, built on
[SkyMP](https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp), the multiplayer for
Skyrim. Fifty years after the civil war, a High King rules over the Jarls.
It has its own launcher, website, Discord bot and voice, all of them here.

It is in alpha and open by application. To join, apply in the
[Discord](https://thornswood.net/discord) and follow
[thornswood.net/join](https://thornswood.net/join). The game is not downloaded here.

## What is in here

- `launcher/`: launcher chrome (window, art, voice page). The C# app lives in
  `launcher/app/` (C# 13 / WPF), built by `scripts/release/Build-Launcher.ps1`
  with MSBuild from `launcher/app/Thornswood.csproj` (#498). See
  `launcher/app/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- `installer/`: what a new person runs first. `installer/setup/` is the small
  setup program people download (one installer tree, not two products).
- `game/`: everything that runs as the multiplayer game on the server and
  clients:
  - `game/gamemode.js`: the server's gamemode
  - `game/data/`: gamemode tables
  - `game/plugins/`: Skyrim Platform JavaScript plugins
  - `game/ui/`: overlays inside the game
  - `game/menu/`: in-game menu pieces
  - `game/content/`: authored content
  - `game/required-data/`: data the client/server must have beside the build
- `site/`: the website. Public pages under `site/data/site`.
- `voice/`: proximity voice.
- `bot/`: the Discord bot (Python).
- `records/`: client and server build records, and code signing
  (`records/signing/`).
- `scripts/`: build, ship, and deploy scripts (`scripts/README.md`).
- `tests/`: harnesses. The build check runs all of them on main, and on a
  pull request built on the VPS only those its change can reach
  (`docs/AFFECTED-HARNESSES.md`).
- `docs/`: system map, update feed, glossary, and runbooks.
- `engine/skymp/`: SkyMP fork submodule. Built by
  `scripts/release/Build-Engine.ps1` (`engine/README.md`).
- `lore/`: the world.
- `out/` and `local/`: build output and machine-local files that never go to
  GitHub (both gitignored).
- `config.example.json`: launcher `config.json` example matching
  `launcher/app/Config.cs` defaults (empty `UpdateToken`). Site example:
  `site/config.example.json`.

`bot`, `game`, `installer`, `records`, `scripts`, `site`, `tests`, `launcher`,
`installer/setup`, `records/signing`, `game/plugins`, `game/ui` and `voice`
each have a README of their own, which says what the folder is and how to
change it.

## Before changing anything

- [Developer-Guide.md](Developer-Guide.md): how to get the code onto your
  computer, open a pull request, ship a dev or main release, deploy the site
  and the gamemode, and post the news. Read it before your first change.
- [docs](docs): the system map, the update feed, the gamemode and a glossary.
  [engine/README.md](engine/README.md): building the SkyMP fork.
- [launcher/app/ARCHITECTURE.md](launcher/app/ARCHITECTURE.md): how the launcher
  starts, what each class owns and every step between Play and the game.
- [docs/IT-IS-DOWN.md](docs/IT-IS-DOWN.md): what to do when the server is down.

Everything reaches `main` through a pull request, and `main` is what ships.
