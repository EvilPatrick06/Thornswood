  Reset-Appearance.ps1

  Puts a character back into the race menu without deleting them.

  How it works, because it is worth knowing it is not a hack: the server
  serialises "no appearance" as appearanceDump: null (MpChangeForms.cpp:46-50),
  reads it back the same way (:210-214), and MpActor::ApplyChangeForm then does

      if (changeForm.appearanceDump.empty()) { changeForm.isRaceMenuOpen = true; }

  because an actor with no appearance would be invisible. MpActor::VisitProperties
  stamps that flag onto the CreateActorMessage, and the client opens the race
  menu on receipt. So clearing the appearance is the supported way to ask for
  character creation again. Inventory, position, spells and everything else on
  the character are untouched.

  THE SERVER MUST BE STOPPED. It holds change forms in memory and writes them
  out on its own schedule, so editing them underneath a running server just gets
  the edit overwritten.
