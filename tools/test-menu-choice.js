// test-menu-choice.js
//
// Choosing a character at the main menu has to actually get you into the world.
//
// WHAT WAS REPORTED, twice, by a playtester and then by Djinn: "click make a
// new character and than are stuck on the main menu with selector menu gone".
// The selector vanishes and the game never loads.
//
// WHY. The pick travels from the page to skymp5-client as a browserMessage.
// The page repeats it every two seconds until something says it heard, because
// SkyrimPlatform loads the page at start and runs plugins about fifteen seconds
// later, so a pick made in that gap would otherwise be lost. That repeat is the
// only thing covering the gap.
//
// thornswood-front.js is NOT skymp5-client. Its own handler saw the pick, wrote
// the choice file and acked the page, which hid the menu and stopped the
// repeat. skymp5-client's AuthService only acts on that message while it is
// waiting for it, and it starts waiting when authNeeded fires. Click before
// that and AuthService returned early, the front plugin acked anyway, the page
// went quiet, and the pick was gone. No authAttempt, no join, and the main menu
// is where you stay. The ack was coming from the wrong side of the room.
//
// So the plugin takes the repeat over instead of ending it, and stops when the
// world is really there rather than after a guess at how long that takes.
//
// Read only.
