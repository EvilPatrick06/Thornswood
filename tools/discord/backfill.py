backfill.py

One-off: post the join card for everybody who came in while the bot had no
channel to post it in (#general had been renamed, so on_member_join logged
"no text channel called #general to greet in" and gave up).

    python backfill.py          list who would get a card, post nothing
    python backfill.py --go     post them, oldest join first

Reads the same bot.env.json as the bot (run.ps1 puts it in the environment).
Who already has a card is worked out from the channels themselves: every card
message is the bot's, says "came up the road." and mentions the person, so the
mentioned ids across #welcome-travelers and #general-chat are the people done.
Anybody else who joined after the newest existing card, and is not a bot, is
owed one. Their number is the one joins.json holds for them, read through
bot.py's own functions; it holds one when the bot numbered them and the
greeting then failed. Somebody it has no number for, which is everybody who
arrived while the bot had nowhere to greet, gets the old rule, their place in
the join order among the members still here, and the line for them says so,
and says when that number is one the record already gave somebody else. A
record that is there and cannot be read stops the run.

It reads joins.json and never writes it, as it never wrote anything before:
it put numbers on cards and kept no record of them. The bot writes the record
on every join, and a second process writing the whole file while the bot runs
could put back a copy from before a number the bot has just given out.
The record is the one beside this file, so run it in the bot's folder on the
VPS; anywhere else there is none and every number is the old rule.
