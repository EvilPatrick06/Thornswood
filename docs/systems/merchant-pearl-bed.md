# Pearl-bed work

The Solstheim Enchanter at `177da:Dragonborn.esm` offers the original pearl-bed
work to an Expert Fisher. It asks for one Pearl, permits three personal draws,
and starts an eight-hour personal rest after completion. Completion consumes
one and keeps the extra two. Abandoning removes the entire outstanding draw
and starts no personal rest. There is no gold reward or purse change.

These three existing Pearl Oysters use base `3828c:Dragonborn.esm`, give
`854fe:Skyrim.esm` (an ingredient), and stand in world `800:Dragonborn.esm`.
Each successful draw gives one Pearl. All fishers share one collection from a
source every60 minutes; personal quest limits do not refill shared stock.

Normal Fisher class, Expert rank, suitable pole and pole coverage remain
required. The source must stay enabled, retain its exact native identity and
base, and remain within128 units of its winning position in the same world.
The character must approach within400 units. Startup rejects unverifiable
native evidence. A missing or failed quest service keeps these selected
oysters shut; oysters elsewhere retain ordinary fishing behavior.

The draw and its quest counter commit in one native inventory/property
transaction against the original snapshot. Refused writes give nothing and
leave the source available. Successful draws use normal fishing progress and
tool wear once. No source, item, NPC, spawn, recipe, yield table, asset or
engine change is added. Alpha quest/trade state is disposable; this section
introduces no historical-state migration or preservation work.

Five other scarce-resource interactions and seven retrievals remain required.
Source implementation and tests do not establish a Dev release; Claude owns
the deployment handoff.
