106 are the cookpot. 16 are the oven. 1 is the grain mill, the sack
of flour, and it is novice. A recipe has no gold price. No row is
race locked.

## Novice, the day-one kitchen

Baked Potatoes, Beef Stew, Cabbage Soup, Carrot Soup, Clam Chowder,
Cooked Beef, Cooked Dog, Cooked Skeever, First Planting Mead, Goat
Roast, Goat Stew, Gourd Soup, Grilled Chicken Breast, Grilled Leeks,
Juniper Tea, Lavender Tea, Midyear Jazbay Wine, Pheasant Roast,
Pheasant Stew, Potato Soup, Rabbit Haunch, Rabbit Stew, Roasted
Carrots, Roasted Mushrooms, Sack of Flour, Salmon Steak, Slaughterfish
Steak, Steamed Mudcrab Legs, Venison Chop, Venison Stew.

Several of those exist twice in the table, a one-portion row and a
two-portion row, which is why 30 names are 55 recipes. A Confectioner
using the sister half can make this novice list and nothing above it.

## Master

Mammoth Steak, twice in the table, 6 gold, meat. Mammoth Stew, twice,
16 gold, stew. Dwemer Fire Paste, 50 gold, the ingredient row.

## Festival dishes and brews

Four festival dishes and four festival brews, one of each for each
season, made from that season's two herbs (#3152, [Food](../../food.md),
"Seasonal food"). The loaf, the tart and the cake are the oven, the roast
and the brews the cookpot. A festival dish is a feast and comes out
burnt, plain or fine like any dish; a brew is an ale.

## Benches and the mill

The oven wants Hearthcook or Confectioner from novice. The mill wants
Hearthcook from novice, so a Confectioner does not mill their own
flour unless this half is theirs or a master has taught it. Flour is
what every dessert asks for. A novice confectioner buys it.

The cookpot opens only for somebody who can make a meal there: a
Hearthcook, or a Confectioner for the novice meals. Anybody else is
turned away before the menu opens.

## What you are handed

The half places 1 in Vitality (+10 health), on top of the cook's
Fortitude and Endurance.

One successful meal is one piece of work. 100 pieces to advanced,
then the count starts again at 250, then at 600. Rest per piece is
1.5, 1.2, 0.9, 0.6 by the rank you are in.

## What you cannot do

You cannot make a dessert past the novice confectioner list unless
Confectioner is your half or a master confectioner has you in the
two outside trades. Those novice desserts are 8 rows, all of them
flour and butter.

You cannot fish, hunt, or farm because you cook. The meat and the
vegetables come from those classes. See [Classes](../../classes.md).

## Where this is

The 123 rows, the oven, the mill, and the flour recipe are in the
server. The hunger numbers a finished meal grants are partly in the
server (unlisted food is 15, and the food table has its own values)
and the plan's raw, burnt, cooked, and feast steps are on
[Food](../../food.md).
