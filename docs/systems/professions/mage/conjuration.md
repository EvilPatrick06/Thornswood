# Conjuration

Bound weapons, atronachs, and the dead raised. The school places 1
in Capacity. The mage profession also places 1 in Capacity, so taking
this school starts you at 2: +20 magicka. See
[Skill tree](../../skill-tree.md).

## What this school is not

A thrall made from a person's character is a death or a permanent
change. It needs the yes. A body the world placed is the spell.

Soul Trap on a person is the same line. A soul gem does not end a
character by itself, and it does not skip the agreement.

A bound weapon is a spell, not an Edgewright recipe, and it is not
a free smithing rank.

Command Daedra and the expel spells do not apply to a person playing
a dremora. Dremora is not a people you can pick. See
[Races](../../races.md).

## Where this is

These 20 names are the server's book.

The server refuses Dead Thrall on a person's body, and every other
spell that raises the dead: Raise Zombie, Reanimate Corpse, Revenant,
Dread Zombie, and a scroll or a staff of one. It knows them by the
game's own Reanimate effect, so a mod's raising spell counts too. A
spell is cast before the server hears of it, so the refusal is its
answer the moment the spell lands: the caster is told, and every
machine that sees the body puts it back down. The person's character
is not touched. A body the world placed is the spell working as
written. The yes on [Death](../../death.md) has no record in the
server, so the server cannot see one, and refuses every time.
