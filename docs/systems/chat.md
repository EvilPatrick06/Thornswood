# Text chat

What you type. Enter opens the box. A line that starts with `/` is a
command. A line that does not is speech.

Speech is local. Two people on the Whiterun road are not read by a
smith in Markarth.

Same cell first. Two people at the same coordinates in different
cells are not in earshot. The distances are in the same units as
`/ooc`, which is 4000 units, about 57 metres.

| How you say it | Who hears it |
| --- | --- |
| A plain line | About 57 metres, same cell |
| `/me` and what the character does | The same |
| `/do` and what there is to see | The same |
| `/w` or `/whisper` | A quarter of that, about 14 metres |
| `/s`, `/shout`, `/y`, or `/yell` | Three times that, about 171 metres |

`/me draws a sword` is an attempt. Whether it lands is the other
person's. A plain line cannot say that.

## Out of character

`/ooc` or `/o`, and the words. The same 57 metres and the same cell.
The line is drawn in brackets, so a scene can see that it stepped
out. It is how a scene asks for the yes on [Death](death.md).
`/ooc can we not` ends the scene. It does not undo what already
happened.

A line longer than 300 characters is cut to 300. If nobody is near
enough, you are told.

## Above the head

A line that is speech also sits above the head, for the people close
enough to read it.

What floats:

- A line that does not start with `/`.
- `/me`, and what the character does.
- `/do`, and what there is to see.
- `/ooc` and `/o`.
- `/w` or `/whisper`, for people inside the whisper reach.
- `/s`, `/shout`, `/y`, or `/yell`, for people inside the shout reach.

What does not float: every other command. `/trade`, `/party`,
`/bard`, `/book`, and the rest stay in the box. `/bard` still pays
the rest on [People beside you](people.md). A lyric above the head
is a plain line or a `/me`.

A friend request, a party invite, and a trade offer are not answered
in the box. A prompt appears with Accept and Refuse. See
[Friends](friends.md), [Party](party.md), and [Trade](trade.md).

The float uses the same reach as the table above, and the same cell.
A plain line, a `/me`, a `/do`, and an `/ooc` float inside about 57
metres. A whisper floats inside about 14 metres. A shout floats
inside about 171 metres. Outside that reach, that line is not above
the head.

One line at a time. A newer line replaces it. It stays for 6 seconds.
The float is cut at 80 characters. The full line stays in the box,
and an `/ooc` in the box is still cut at 300.

The float has the same shape as the box. A plain line is the words.
A `/me` is the action. A `/do` is what there is to see. An `/ooc` is
in brackets. A whisper and a shout use the same words they use in
the box.

An emote uses this same one line. The names are on
[Emotes](emotes.md). A newer typed line replaces it, and an emote
replaces a typed line.

You see your own float. Someone who has turned off your text does not
see it, in the box or above the head. That switch is on
[Voice](voice.md). The speaking mark on that page is the microphone.
It is not this text.

## Where this is

`/ooc` is local, 4000 units, same cell, in the server. `/me`, `/do`,
`/w`, and `/s` are local too, whether or not the plain-line switch is
on. They are not sent on to the game server.

Plain speech in the box is local on the dev voice service: the same
cell, 4000 units, the same reach as the line above the head. The
switch still exists. Left unset, a plain line still goes to
everybody, which is how the live voice service is left.

The line above the head is local either way: 4000 units for a
plain line, a `/me`, a `/do`, and an `/ooc`, 1000 for a whisper, and
12000 for a shout. Same cell first. One line, 6 seconds, cut at 80
characters. You see your own. Text mute hides it in the box and
above the head.

Staff silence stops the words above the head as well as the box. It
does not hide a name.
