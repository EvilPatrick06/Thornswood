# Notice boards

One board a town. You stand at it to post, to read the one in front of
you, and to take a job. Reading another town's board does not require
standing there: J has every one, under Boards.

## Where a board is

The object is the message board. One stands at every board, wherever
the server has it: indoors or out, in Skyrim or on Solstheim. The server
stands it, and its drop box, as its own references that every game is
sent (#2516): a board in Tamriel at once, one in any other cell or
worldspace the first time somebody is there. Until 12 Oct each game put
its own copies down, and lost them in cells that were not loaded, so it
kept putting new ones down at the person. You are at it when you are
within 400 of that board. Click the board: E on the board itself opens
it, and nothing else does. E on a person beside it, or on anything else
near it, is answered by that, not the board (Patrick, 12 Oct, #2298:
clicking the board does only the board).

The board is Thornswood's own, built from Skyrim's own pieces (#2298):
two Windhelm sign posts, a face of stockade planks between two log
rails, a gable of shingle boards, a candle lantern on a bracket, and
notices nailed to it. On a shelf on its right post sits the hold's drop
box. It is about 3.5 metres tall and 4.4 wide with the shelf.
`scripts/mods/Build-NoticeBoard.py` builds both meshes from the game's
own archives; only the meshes ship, never a texture.

A steward moves it. Standing where it should be, facing the way its
notices should face, they press its town under the notice boards on the
Office page of the K panel, and press again. The server records the cell
or worldspace, the point and the facing where they stand, and moves the
board and its box there. A board a steward has walked to is saved, and a
later seeding does not put it back.

Solitude, Whiterun, Windhelm, Riften and Markarth are walled cities, each
its own worldspace inside the walls, and their boards stand inside them:
their spots were read there, which the game's own people placed nearby,
and Solitude's own ground, measured on 15 Oct (#2516). Until then all
nine were sent as Tamriel, so inside those cities no board ever stood.
Falkreath, Morthal, Dawnstar and Winterhold are open towns in Tamriel.

The nine mainland towns have a spot each: Solitude, Whiterun, Riften,
Windhelm, Markarth, Falkreath, Morthal, Dawnstar, Winterhold. Raven
Rock's board starts at that town's inn, The Retching Netch, where
Geldis Sadri stands, until a steward walks it somewhere better. Ten
boards, one per town in [Creation](creation.md).

## The drop box

The hold's drop box stands on the shelf on the board's right post, an
iron strongbox with a coin slot (Patrick, 12 Oct, #2298). E on the box
opens the box's own panel, and only the box: E on the board opens the
board. You use it standing at the board, within 400 of it. The server
stands the box beside its board and turns it with the board, and what is
in it is the server's own record, never a chest's contents.

What goes in:

- Gold. Gold you put in pays what you owe on your rent first.
- Something left for somebody who was not there to take it, a Free
  Skyrim Trading Company drop off: you pick it from your pack and name who
  it is for, and the hold's steward hands it out.
- Carriage and ferry fares, by themselves, as real gold, each time a fare
  is paid to a driver or a ferryman of that hold.

Notice, job and letter fees never go in. They leave the world and stay a
record on the server, the hold's ledger, so the Court never has gold
that does not exist.

Who sees and takes what:

- Anybody sees only what they put in themselves, gold included: only the
  gold they added, never the box's total. They may take back what they
  put in, rent included, and then that rent is owed again.
- That hold's officers, its Court, its Guards, its Jarl and its
  Steward, each by the hold's Discord role (#2551), see
  everything in it and may take anything. Only they get Records: every
  deposit and every take, by character name, what, how much, and when,
  newest first. An officer taking gold somebody paid rent with leaves the
  rent paid.

Nothing about the box is typed. The panel's buttons send the server lines
nobody is told to type (Patrick, 4 Oct).

## A notice and a job

Every post has a title and a body (Patrick, 15 Oct, #2554). Make a post
is a button in the foot of the board's panel, apart from the list, so
the posts above it scroll. It asks for a title, up to 60 characters,
the body, up to 600, and Job or Notice. Both the title and the body are
needed. The server checks both lengths as well as the page, and refuses
an empty or too long one with a plain line before any gold is taken.

A notice is 20 gold. It is read only. There is nothing to take.

A job is 30 gold and its reward, a whole number of gold above nothing,
taken together. The 30 is the board's. The reward is held on the
hold's ledger, the way a haul's pay is held, until the person who posted
the job says it is done with Pay the reward on it, at that board. Then
the whole reward goes to whoever took it. The server does not judge
whether a job was done; its poster says so.

The fee and a job's reward are taken from the pack before it goes up. If
the gold is not there, nothing is posted. They are counted on that
hold's ledger. See [Gold](gold.md) and [Property](property.md).

Posts from before titles were not converted: the board shipped only to
dev, and in alpha nothing is carried over.

The fees are the same for everybody. The [Merchant's Guild](merchants-guild.md)
is the NPC traders; people cannot join it for a discount.

A haul is a job with a pay and a destination. The posting fee is still
this fee. The pay is extra. See
[Free Skyrim Trading Company](trading-company.md).

A letter is a job with a named person at the other end. You post it
from the board's panel: Write a letter, with who it is for and the
words. The words are the letter, up to 300 characters, the same cap
as `/ooc`.

It costs 35 gold up front. 20 is the board fee and stays with the hold.
15 is the courier's pay, and it is held
the way a haul's pay is held. If the gold is not there, nothing is
posted.

The courier does not read it. The wall shows who it is for, not the
words. Take takes it the way it takes a job. One taker. Looking at
the named person, within the trade reach, about 10 metres, the
courier's look prompt shows E, Hand over the letter. E hands them the
words and pays the courier the 15. The row is there only while you
carry a letter for the person you are looking at. A wrong person is
refused. The server does not judge what the letter says. It checks
the name.

Put it back puts the letter back on the board. Take down, by the
sender, before it is delivered, returns the 15 and keeps the board fee. A
letter somebody has taken stays up until they hand it back or deliver
it. There is no cooldown. The sender's gold is the limit.

You post from the board. A notice sent from the other side of the
province is not a notice. A letter is the same: you write it standing
there.

## What the board shows

Clicking the board shows the one you are standing at. J shows any
town's, from anywhere: under Boards, pick the town. That one is read
only, and Your jobs is under it.

The newest 10 that are still up are the wall. Each keeps the number of
its real place in the list. A notice taken down leaves a gap in the
numbers rather than sliding the newer ones down.

Older ones stay in the book. They are not on the wall. The line under
the ten says how many are older. The buttons use the numbers on the
wall.

A notice or a job shows its title, Job or Notice, a job's reward, who
posted it and when, and who took it once somebody has. Read opens it:
its body, and Take on a job. J shows the title and the body together.
A letter line says it is a letter, and names who it is for.

## Taking, handing back, taking down

Take, beside a job at the board, puts it on your list. A notice cannot
be taken. A job already taken cannot be taken again. Your jobs is your
list, every job you have taken in every town: on the board's panel,
and under Boards on J.

Put it back, at the board you took it from, hands it back, and it is
open on the board again, its reward still held. The server records who
took it and when. It does not decide whether a job was done. Pay the
reward, on the poster's own job once somebody has taken it, pays the
taker the whole reward out of the ledger and takes the job down; a taker
who is away is paid when they are next in the world. A letter's 15 is
paid when it is delivered to the named person, from gold the sender
already put up.

Take down is the poster's. The fee stays with the hold, and a job's
reward comes back to the poster. A job somebody has taken stays up until
they hand it back.

A guard of the hold takes down any post on its board, taken or not
(#502), and so does the hold's Jarl (#2551). The fee stays with the hold. Gold the post was holding goes back
to whoever posted it: a job's reward, a letter's 15, a haul's pay. When they are away it
is held for them and handed over when they are back. Whoever had taken
it is told it is off their list. At another hold's board a guard or a
Jarl is anybody. See [Offices](offices.md).

## Where this is

The board is a panel. Stand at the message board and click it. Make a
post, notices and jobs with Read, taking one, Pay the reward, taking
your own down, handing a job back, Your jobs with
Put it back on this board's, the line that counts the older ones, and
leaving a price list are on that panel. Walking away closes it. A
steward of the hold moves its board from the Office page of the K
panel. See
[Offices](offices.md).

J has a Boards tab (#1627): the ten towns, the board of the one you
pick, read only, from anywhere, and Your jobs under it. The town that
is lit is the one the server is showing; after a restart none is.

Nothing on a board is typed (Patrick, 4 Oct: nothing people do is a
chat command). The panel and J send the server lines nobody is told to
type, and no help text names them.

Fees of 20 and 30, a post's title of up to 60 and body of up to 600, a
job's reward held and Pay the reward, the reach of 400, the newest 10,
the gaps, the older count, Take, Put it back, Take down, Your jobs, and
a steward moving a board are in the server. The fee lands on the hold's ledger.
A steward moves one of the ten boards; any other name is refused.

Letters are in the server and on the panels (#1595): Write a letter
on the board's panel, the 35, the 300 characters, the sealed line on
the wall and the panels, Take, Put it back, the 15 back on Take
down, and Hand over the letter on the look prompt, which pays the
courier the 15 out of the ledger it was held on. The name on a letter
matches the whole of a character's name or its first words. The
prompt's row comes from the server's list of who is near you, which
marks a person you carry a letter for; the key sends the id the
crosshair gives, the same as Trade, and the server checks the name,
the reach and the place again. The key is E, Skyrim's own Activate,
wherever it is bound: which key was asked on #1595, and E is the
suggested answer, because every letter is already taken and U, the
other key on a person, is Let sleep here, which can be up at the same
time. Nothing is typed for a letter, and no help text names a line
for one.

Hauls are in the server, on the panel: Send a haul, the 30 fee and
the pay on the ledger, the pay and the destination on the wall, and
Confirm under Hauls that came here at the destination. A haul handed
back is not open again: it comes down, and its pay goes back to the
poster. A steward sees Take down on every haul. There is no command
for any of it. See [Free Skyrim Trading Company](trading-company.md).

Ten boards are seeded, and each one is that hold's drop box. Raven
Rock's is at The Retching Netch, where Geldis Sadri stands, and its
message board object goes down on that spot. Nobody has yet checked
in the game that it stands clear of him; a steward can walk it to a
better one (#1597). Pressing E on
a person or an NPC near a board answers them, not the board. Solitude's
spot was corrected from a walked coordinate and still wants somebody
to stand on it. There is no guild membership discount.
