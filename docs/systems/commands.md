# Chat commands

Every line starting with a slash that the game answers, who may use it,
what it does, where it is read, and where people are told about it.

The rule is on [Thornswood systems](../SYSTEMS.md), "Buttons, not
commands". Decided by Patrick on 4 Oct: anything a person does in the
world is a key, a prompt, a panel, or the thing itself activated. Staff
and dev commands stay commands. Each command for people below has an
issue that turns it into buttons, except `/stuck`, `/helpme` and
`/report`, which stay commands (Patrick, later on 4 Oct: "change it to
except the /stuck and the ones for getting help from GMs"), and the
ways of saying a line and `/roll`, which stay commands with no buttons
(Patrick, 4 Oct, #1639: "Allow those commands and don't do buttons"),
and `/needs`, the needs bars as a line of text for somebody who hid them
(Patrick, 11 Oct, #2267).
The umbrella is #1620.

File and line numbers are main at 9b5a667 on 4 Oct. They move as the
files change, so each row also names the function or block.

## How a line travels

Enter opens the chat box (`game/ui/thornswood-chat.js`). A line that
starts with a slash goes to the voice service, which is not the game
server. The voice service says `/me`, `/do`, `/w` and `/s` itself and
never passes them on (`voice/voice-server.js:CHAT_VERBS`). Every other slash
line is queued for the game server, which collects the queue in the
chat commands block of `game/gamemode.js`: `dispatch` first,
then `handle`.

Two lists in that block decide what people are told. `WORDS` is every
word the server answers. `PLAYER_WORDS` is the words named to everybody,
and since #1633 it is exactly the commands that stay, the rows below that
say so: `/stuck`, `/helpme`, `/report`, `/me`, `/do`, `/w`, `/s`, `/y`,
`/ooc`, `/roll` and `/needs`. `helpLine` reads it: the answer to `/help` and
`/commands`, and the end of the reply to a word the server does not know,
"No command called ... Help is a panel: F7 opens it ... Typed in the
chat: ...". In the tables below, "the list" means `PLAYER_WORDS`.

The help in the game is a panel since #1633 (`game/ui/thornswood-help.js`):
its own key, HelpKey in `Thornswood.ini` (F7), on the launcher's Controls
page, and Help on the K, P and J panels (Patrick's answer on #1633). Its
topics are talking, people, living, work, land and getting help, written
as keys, prompts and panels, with every key named as that machine has it
bound. It names the commands that stay and no other.

Other places that tell people to type a command: the help panel, the
launcher's Help page (`launcher/app/Help.cs`, "Chat and commands"), the
system pages in this folder, the site's pages in `site/data/site`, and
the server's own answers. Each conversion issue took its commands out of
all of them.

## Commands for people

Each of these becomes buttons, except the rows that say they stay.
The server may keep a line as an internal message that a key or a panel
sends, the way Y, H and L on the look prompt send `/friend`, `/trade`
and `/mute` with the id under the crosshair. Nobody is told to type it,
and help text never lists it.

| Command | Who | What it does | Read at | Where people are told | Buttons today, then to come | Issue |

Study button on the College page (#1387), and `/pick weave warmth` or
`/pick weave armour` from Warmth and Armour on a Master Weaver's
profession card (#1398). K sends them and nothing tells anybody to
type them, so there is nothing to turn.

## Staff and dev commands

These stay commands. How to run each one, with examples:
[Developer-Guide.md, Q. Staff commands](../../Developer-Guide.md#q-staff-commands).

| Command | Who | What it does | Read at | Where staff are told |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/tp <place>`, `/goto <place>`, `/tp` | Testers and dev: the Playtester role on Discord (the door's allowed list), the written playtester and dev lists, and the admins | Moves you to a town or a named place; `/tp` alone lists the places | `gamemode.js:word === '/tp'`, `isPlaytester` | The reply to `/help` and to a word nobody has adds a line for them, and for nobody else (`helpLine`) |
| `/give <item> [count]`, `/spawn <creature> [count] [keep]` | Testers and dev | Makes items in your pack, or creatures beside you. A spawned creature is temporary unless the line ends in `keep` (#2623): when it dies its body lies the usual time, then it is gone, and a restart takes it too. Who may use `keep` is `SPAWN_KEEP_WHO` (testers and staff for now) | `gamemode.js:word === '/give'` | The same line |

| `/embassy`, `/embassy add <name> [armed]`, `arm`, `disarm`, `remove` | Admins only | Shows and writes the embassy roll: 20, of whom 6 may be marked armed; the 21st and the 7th armed are refused (#1390) | `command` in the embassy and remnant block | [The Imperial Embassy](embassy.md), [Offices](offices.md) |
| `/remnant`, `/remnant add <name>`, `remove` | Admins only | Shows and writes the Thalmor remnant roll, once an application is accepted (#1390) | `command` in the embassy and remnant block | [The Thalmor](thalmor.md) |

| `/restart`, `/shutdown` | Nobody | Answers that restarts are not run from chat | `gamemode.js:word === '/restart'` | Nowhere |
| `/close` (Discord), and the Close ticket button | Staff: the bot's `STAFF_ROLES` (Owner, Dev, Gamemaster, Moderator, Loremaster), by id or name; Manage Threads alone is not staff (#1342) | Closes a ticket, and only in a ticket's own thread; anywhere else it says it only works inside a ticket (#1776) | `close_here`, `is_ticket_thread` and `is_staff` in `bot/bot.py` | Discord's own command list |
| `/test-task` (Discord) | Owner, Dev and Lead Gamemaster (`TEST_TASK_ROLES`) | One thread in the #test-tasks forum, tagged Dev or Main | `test_task_cmd` and `post_test_task` in `bot/bot.py` | Discord's own command list |
| `python bot.py --setup-channels [--apply]` (VPS, by hand) | Whoever runs it on the VPS | The one-time testing channel setup: #test-tasks to a forum, #test-results to #test-findings, #known-issues made; a preview without `--apply`, never twice | `channel_setup` in `bot/bot.py` | `data\channel-setup.json` |

## Lines the game sends itself

Nobody types these, and nothing tells anybody to. They are how the
client reports what only it can see. They stay.

The voice service's chat log, which staff read for a report, leaves out
the ones the front plugin sends by itself (#2723,
`voice/voice-server.js:PLUGIN_REPORTS`): `/joinpass`, `/place`, `/burn`,
`/loadorder` and `/loadorderlight`, `/afk active`, `/face done`,
`/racemenu` and `/racedown`, `/modset`, `/ate`, `/chopped`, `/tspicks`,
`/rest`, and the panels' `refresh`. It writes the ones a key, E, a pick
or a button sends, marked as a key press (#2251; the chat page marks
every line that does not come from the chat box, #2732), and the wait in line
once when it starts and once when it ends (#1131). Every one of them
still reaches the game server, and the same line typed in the chat box
is written as typed.

| Line | Sent by | What it reports | Read at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/joinpass <pass>` | The front plugin | The launcher's join pass | `gamemode.js:word === '/joinpass'` |
| `/line`, `/line leave`, `hand`, `gone` | The front plugin at the menu, and the voice service | The line to get in while the world is full | `gamemode.js:word === '/line'` |

| `/face done`, `/racemenu` | The front plugin | The race menu closed, or is up | `gamemode.js:if (word === '/face') {` |
| `/modset` | The front plugin | Mod settings menu values that changed | `gamemode.js:if (word === '/modset') {` |
| `/ate <id>` | The front plugin | Something was eaten or drunk | `gamemode.js:word === '/ate'` |
| `/place`, `/burn` | The front plugin | Where you stand for warmth, and being on fire, which is also timed for a burn wound | `gamemode.js:if (word === '/place') {`, `gamemode.js:word === '/burn'` |
| `/chopped` | The front plugin | A fall of the axe at a chopping block | `gamemode.js:if (word === '/chopped') {` |
| `/loadorder` | The front plugin | The client's load order | `gamemode.js:word === '/loadorder'` |
| `/tspicks <n>` | The front plugin | Lockpicks that broke | `gamemode.js:word === '/tspicks'` |
