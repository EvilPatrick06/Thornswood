# Thirst

Thirst is a meter from 0 to 100. It starts at 100. It falls twice as
fast as hunger.

## The clock

It empties in 1 hour and 12 minutes. That is 83.33 points an hour.
Cold speeds it on the same steps as hunger: 1.25 when cold is weary,
1.5 at bad, 2 at spent. See [Temperature](temperature.md).

## The bands

| Meter | Band | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 50 and up | Fine | Nothing |
| 25 to 49 | Weary | -20 magicka, -3 speed |
| 10 to 24 | Bad | -40 magicka, -7 speed |
| 0 to 9 | Spent | -60 magicka, -12 speed, -30% magicka recovery |

## What a swallow is worth

| Thing | Thirst |
| --- | --- |
| An ordinary drink | 20 |
| The first ale | 30, then less. See [Drink](drink.md) |
| A potion or a poison | 5 |

A poison counts as a sip because putting it on a blade and drinking it
are the same event.

A stew or a soup that is food also gives a little thirst when it is a
liquid meal. See [Food](food.md). A dry ration does not.

## Water

Clean water is a well, an inn, or a skin bought or filled at a well. A
river is drinkable and better boiled. Marsh, a puddle, and standing
water you did not boil can foul you. The sea is salt: it quenches at
half a normal drink, 10, and can sicken. Swimming in that water is
temperature, not this meter. See [Disease](disease.md).

## Sleep

Logging out lying in a bed indoors stops the clock while you are away.
After a night away, your own bed or one you are allowed in adds 25
thirst, and an inn or temple bed nobody holds adds 15. Anywhere else,
thirst falls at half its pace while you are away and the time away
takes it no lower than 25. See [Exhaustion](exhaustion.md), Logging
out.

## Where this is

The clock, the bands, the 20, the ale curve and the potion sip of 5 are
in the server, and so is cold speeding thirst. The server does not yet
know whether the water you drank was a well or a ditch. Soups do not
yet add thirst on top of hunger. The bed is the one the server saw
them lie down in, by whose it is, the same as for rest. See
[Exhaustion](exhaustion.md).
