# The Discord layout

Made from `bot/Build-Discord.py` (ROLES and PLAN) by
`python3.12 bot/Build-Discord.py --layout`. Do not edit it by hand:
change the plan and run that, and `bot/test-3317-layout.py` fails when
the two differ. `Setup-Discord.ps1 -OnBox -Audit` says where the live
server differs from this page. Issue #3317 is where it was set out.

## The staff council

Each staff category has a lead, and the leads are the council: they
decide together, and Owner and Co-Owner make the final call. A person
holds at most one rank in a category (Lead Dev and Dev is a double);
ranks of two categories are fine, and Owner or Co-Owner with a lead is
fine. The audit reports every double.

Nobody on staff holds a seat of the world: a Jarl or a faction leader.
A Jarl is a faction leader with its own application, which lists only
the holds with no Jarl. The audit reports anybody holding both.

Leads and Support hold Manage Roles and give only their own
category's roles (Support gives Playtester). Every staff role sits
above every other role.

| Category | Its space | Lead | Ranks under the lead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dev | Dev | Lead Dev | Dev |
| Gamemasters | Gamemasters | Lead Gamemaster | Gamemaster, Trial Gamemaster |
| Lore | Lore | Lead Loremaster | Loremaster |
| Moderation | Moderation | Lead Moderator | Moderator |
| Content | Content | Lead Content Creator | Content Creator |
| Support | Support | Lead Support | Support |

Holders of Moderator also talk in the Gamemasters space.

@everyone keeps what the server gives it; the build does not change it,
and the audit prints it. Every other role opens exactly the channels
below that name it.

The bot's own role keeps Administrator, for a build and the rest of the
time (Patrick, 22 Oct 2026: "the bot will keep admin"). The audit counts
it holding Administrator as planned, and its going without as a
difference. What the running bot itself uses is RUN_BITS in the builder.

talks means posts as well; posts in a read only place means writes and
tidies there. A staff space mode is said for the space it names.
