# Gamemode coverage map

Which test in tests/ drives each event handler in game/gamemode.js, each
plugin in game/plugins/, and the chat words. Made 10 October 2026 by
grepping tests/*.js for each name, then reading the closest test.

## The eleven events

| Handler | Line (at ba910a3) | Tests that drive it |
|---|---|---|
| mp.onDeath | 5793 | test-audit-handlers, test-1383-injury, test-1385-perks, test-1386-warrior, test-1831-dead-waits, test-join-pass-trust, and 3 more |
| mp.onRespawn | 5984 | test-npc-death-policy (drives it), test-audit-handlers, test-1383-injury |
| mp.onActivate | 8299 | 15 files: test-audit-handlers, test-1603-beds, test-1733-injury-gate, test-1909-own-worlds, test-626-tundra-cotton, and more |
| mp.onCraft | 27679 | 12 files: test-1389-lists, test-1390-embassy, test-1398-fuel, test-1400-smith-tan, test-1676-rest-gate, and more. Left alone in this sweep: #1648 lands here |
| mp.onUpdateEquipmentAttempt | 46859 | test-1387-college (drives it), test-audit-handlers |
| mp.onReadBook | 47249 | test-spell-tomes, test-1127-unplaceable-tomes, test-1149-pick-spell-tome, test-enchanter-staff-spells, test-audit-handlers, test-join-pass-trust |
| mp.onPutItem (putIn) | 51231 | test-coffers (drives putIn), test-audit-handlers, test-join-pass-trust |
| mp.onTakeItem | 51522 | test-take-limit (drives it), test-audit-handlers, test-join-pass-trust |
| mp.onDropItem | 51536 | test-audit-handlers, test-1384-condition, test-join-pass-trust |
| mp.onUpdateAppearanceAttempt | 51634 | test-body-shape, test-unpublished-until-appearance, test-audit-handlers, test-join-pass-trust |
| mp.onEatItem | 56553 | test-1383-injury (drives swallowed()), test-audit-handlers |

Every handler has at least one test that runs it, not just a test that
checks its source text.

## The plugins

## Chat words

Of the 91 words handle() and the blocks answer, 89 were already in some
test. These two were not:

- /shutdown: no test ever sent it. Only /restart showed up, and only in
  lists of words. Now covered by test-chat-refusals: an admin and playtester
  typing /restart or /shutdown, in any case and with or without trailing
  words, gets the refusal sentence, the refusal is logged, and no restart
  file is written.
- /deeds: now covered by test-chat-refusals, which checks it gives the same
  answer as /deed.

test-chat-refusals also checks that /give and /spawn are refused for
somebody on no list even with an admin online, that the uppercase word gets
the same refusal, and that an unproven line under the join pass places
nothing.

## Left out on purpose

- The durability block (#1384), which belongs to Anvil.
- mp.onCraft, where Anvil's 9ce36701 (#1648) lands.

## Found along the way, not changed

- A /spawn or /give from somebody whose character is not in the world yet is
  held with "That will run as soon as you arrive", even when they are on no
  list. It is refused when it does run, so nothing is given, but the first
  reply promises something that will not happen.
