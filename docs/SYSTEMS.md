# Thornswood systems

How a life works here. Creation, work, the body, coin, property and the
road. Hunger and warmth are sections of it.

Each section is the shape of that system and a link to the
page that holds the detail, including the numbers. The detail pages are
the plan for the finished system. What is already in the server, and what
is not, is at the bottom of each of those pages and not in the middle of
them.

The item lists sit in [systems/lists](systems/lists/README.md). They are
generated from the recipe, harvest, ore and hunt tables.

## Buttons, not commands

Decided by Patrick on 4 Oct: "can we stop with the commands, I want
things to be buttons, it's nicer and more immersive", and "no more
commands for things [people] do, only for dev and staff commands;
everything else takes buttons and GUI, so whatever isn't needs fixed
as well".

Every page here follows this. Anything a person does in the world is
done in the game, never by typing a line in the chat. That means one
of these:

- a key named on the look prompt, the panel that names who or what is
  under the crosshair: Y for a friend, H to trade, L to mute, U to
  press a key mold into a door, E to hand over a letter you carry for
  them, X to tend their wounds, and for a guard 0 to bind or free them;
- a key of its own, the way X claims, locks or unlocks the door you
  just opened, cuts a key at a forge and claims a farm at a crop;
- the prompt that answers an offer with Accept and Refuse, and the P
  panel of friends and the party;
- a panel: K for the profession, the class, the skill tree and the
  body, J for journals, group books and every town's notice board, the
  notice board itself, the trade window, a trader's wares, and the help,
  on F7 and on Help on the K, P and J panels (#1633);
- activating the thing itself in the world: E on a board, its drop box, a driver or
  a trader, lying down in a bed, sitting on a seat;
- the emote wheel: Sit is a seat on the ground, and a lute, a flute,
  a drum or Sing is the bard.

Staff and dev commands stay commands: moderation (`/kick`,
`/silence`, `/ban` and the rest), and the testers' `/tp`, `/give`
and `/spawn`.

Getting help stays a command too. Decided by Patrick later on 4 Oct:
"change it to except the /stuck and the ones for getting help from
GMs". `/stuck`, and the lines that reach staff, `/helpme` (and
`/help-me`) and `/report`, are typed in the chat, and the help in the
game, the launcher's Help and the site name them.

Talking stays a command as well. Decided by Patrick later on 4 Oct,
about the ways of saying a line and the dice (#1639): "Allow those
commands and don't do buttons." `/me`, `/do`, `/w` (`/whisper`), `/s`
(`/shout`), `/y` (`/yell`), `/ooc` (`/o`) and `/roll` (`/r`) are typed
in the chat box, with no buttons for them, and the help in the game,
the launcher's Help, [Text chat](systems/chat.md) and the site's rules
name them.

The needs bars as text stay a command too. Decided by Patrick on
11 Oct (#2267): `/needs` (and `/need`) says the four bars as one line of
text, for somebody who hid the bars in the launcher's Settings and wants
a quick look at them. It is another view of what the bars and the Body
page on K already show, so it is an exception, like the ones above. The
help in the game, the launcher's Help and the Settings line under the
bars name it.

A panel or a key may send the server the same line a command used to
be. The look prompt already sends `/trade` and the id of the person
under the crosshair. Nobody is told to type that line, and help text
never lists it.

A page below that still tells people to type something other than
getting help or talking is out of date on that point. [Chat commands](systems/commands.md)
lists every command the game answers today, who may use it, and the
issue that turns each one for people into buttons. A new system is
written with its buttons from the start.

## A person arrives

[Creation](systems/creation.md). A new character is made in a stone hall.
The face is the game's. The town is required before they leave. Class and
profession can wait. They start with 40 gold, a tunic and boots, and a tool
if the pick needs one.

[Races](systems/races.md). Ten peoples from the base game, and rieklings.
A material named for a people is a smithing tier and is open to every race.
A people's own dress is locked to that race. The locked recipes are listed.

[Death](systems/death.md). The world can kill you. Another person cannot
end your character without agreement. You wake in a temple. Wounds are a
separate page.

## The body

[Hunger](systems/hunger.md). Empties in 2 hours 24 minutes. Bands at 50,
25, 10 and 0.

[Thirst](systems/thirst.md). Empties in 1 hour 12 minutes, twice as fast
as hunger. Ale and potions are drinks, with their own pages.

[Exhaustion](systems/exhaustion.md). Called rest on the bar. Empties in 8
hours. A seat recovers 20 an hour, a bed nobody can lend you 25, a seat
by a fire 35, that bed by a fire 45, a bed you are allowed in 50, and
your own bed 80. Crafting stops under 15.

[Food](systems/food.md). Raw, burnt, cooked, and a feast. Eating takes
time. A full stomach refuses another meal's help.

[Drink and ale](systems/drink.md). Clean water, fouled water, and ale that
gets worse with each one inside 45 minutes.

[Potions and restoration](systems/potions.md). A potion is a small drink.
Later potions in a short window heal less. Restoration strains.

[The body](systems/body.md). Optional. After the server is fully live,
a vote decides whether this slow need is added. Until that vote it
is not built.

[Temperature and weather](systems/temperature.md). One meter, 0 to 100,
comfort at 50. Place, wind, sky, night, height, fire, water and clothing.
A season changes the odds of the sky. Winter is not all snow.

[Injury](systems/injury.md). Cuts, breaks, burns, bites, and going down
before a death. Lasting harm is part of this, not a separate switch.

[Disease](systems/disease.md). Chill, food sickness, fouled water, wound
fever, bite sickness. Not the old survival mod.

## Work

[Professions and sub-professions](systems/professions.md). Eight
professions, two halves each, four ranks. The overview is the ladder,
the benches, and how a recipe gets its rank. Each half's own page
lists every recipe: the name, the rank, what it asks for, and
whether the server is asked. An item has no gold price.

[Masters and apprentices](systems/apprenticeship.md). The sister half
past novice, and the two outside trades. A master decides, and either
of you can end it.

[Durability](systems/durability.md). Weapon Kit, Armor Kit, Sewing
Kit. The right half repairs to 120%. Anyone else repairs to 100%.
Worn gear loses 1% a hit. At 0%, a worn piece can break.

[Cut items](systems/cut-items.md). What leaves the open book, and the
references kept so a row can come back. The recipe file is not
deleted.

| Profession | Halves |
| --- | --- |
| [Warrior](systems/professions/warrior.md) | [Bulwark](systems/professions/warrior/bulwark.md), [Berserker](systems/professions/warrior/berserker.md) |

| [Alchemist](systems/professions/alchemist.md) | [Blightbrewer](systems/professions/alchemist/blightbrewer.md), [Physicker](systems/professions/alchemist/physicker.md) |

| [Woodworker](systems/professions/woodworker.md) | [Charburner](systems/professions/woodworker/charburner.md), [Woodwright](systems/professions/woodworker/woodwright.md) |

[Classes](systems/classes.md). One class, separate from the profession.
Until it is picked, every seam, carcass, plant, fishing spot and crop
turns you away.

| Class | Page |
| --- | --- |
| Hunter | [classes/hunter.md](systems/classes/hunter.md) |
| Fisher | [classes/fisher.md](systems/classes/fisher.md) |
| Gatherer | [classes/gatherer.md](systems/classes/gatherer.md) |
| Miner | [classes/miner.md](systems/classes/miner.md) |
| Farmer | [classes/farmer.md](systems/classes/farmer.md) |

[Skill tree](systems/skill-tree.md). Fifteen sub-skills, five points to
fill one, and what one point is worth.

## Law, magic, and who is standing there

[Magic and the College](systems/magic.md). Who may cast, how a spell
is learned, a 24 hour semester, and what is refused. The spell names
are on the school pages above.

[The Thalmor](systems/thalmor.md). A hostile life, not a profession.
Patrols on the roads. No coin from them.

[The Imperial Embassy](systems/embassy.md). One house in Solitude.
20 on the roll, 6 of them armed, and only inside the walls.

[People beside you](systems/people.md). The index. Each of these is
its own system.

| System | Page |
| --- | --- |
| Friends | [Friends](systems/friends.md) |
| Party | [Party](systems/party.md) |
| Trade | [Trade](systems/trade.md) |
| Journals | [Journals](systems/journal.md) |
| Factions and businesses | [Factions and businesses](systems/factions.md) |
| Voice | [Voice](systems/voice.md) |
| Emotes | [Emotes](systems/emotes.md) |
| Text chat | [Text chat](systems/chat.md) |

A friend request, a party invite, and a trade offer are answered on a
prompt, with Accept and Refuse. The offer stands for 45 seconds. The
emote wheel is eight quick slots and a searchable list.

[Mixtures](systems/mixtures.md). The potions and poisons a lab may
brew, by rank. Anything else is refused.

[Enchantments](systems/enchantments.md). What may be put on a weapon
or on clothing, and which soul gem a rank may use.

[People who are not people](systems/npcs.md). Guild traders and limited
animals inside cities; transport workers outside their walls. Camps,
ambushes, dungeon enemies and wildlife stay in suitable habitats under
server authority. Caves and dungeons have fixed location tiers. Town
fillers are cut. Hunting and fishing use shared, persistent stock. Exact
guild relocation is deferred. No bounty.

[Offices](systems/offices.md). Jarl, steward, and the titles that are
not a recipe and not a mint.

## Holds, coin and the road

[Property](systems/property.md). A claim at the door, a deed, locks, keys,
rent, and what a home is for.

[Gold](systems/gold.md). 40 gold once for a person. A guild trader
starts with 250, once. A scene quest creates the gold written on it,
on that quest's cooldown. A company sale can take some coin out of
the world. It does not buy a rank.

[Dungeon loot](systems/dungeon-loot.md). A chest in a dungeon, a cave,
or a sewer pays gold, ordinary goods, and sometimes a novice or master
spell tome, from the tier of that place. The boss chest at the end
pays one tier higher. A few burial goods are found
only this way. A dead body can be searched too, and anything good on
it is rare.

[Notice boards](systems/noticeboards.md). One board a hold. 20 gold for a
notice, 30 for a job. A letter costs the board fee plus 15 for the
courier, paid by the sender. The newest ten show.

[Merchant's Guild](systems/merchants-guild.md). The merchant NPCs of a hold.
People cannot join it. Traders start with 250 and buy and
sell at the average of the price lists submitted there. It does not
mint coin after that purse, and it is not a profession.

[Custom quests](systems/quests.md). Guild traders ask for goods. A supply
quest pays from the trader's purse. A scarce quest opens a place that
holds more than the turn-in, for a class, a profession, or a race. A
scene quest pays a set amount, usually for a retrieval, and that
gold does not run out. It does not buy goods. A letter is on the
notice board, and the sender pays.

[Free Skyrim Trading Company](systems/trading-company.md). Hauls between
holds. The hauler is paid out of the box. The company keeps 10%. It is not
the East Empire Company.

[Carriages and ferries](systems/carriages.md). How you travel with fast
travel off. A fade, not a ride that has to stay in sync.

## Where a number comes from

A number in a detail page is the plan's number. If the server already uses
it, the bottom of that page says so. If the page is ahead of the server,
the bottom says what is missing. Nothing in this folder changes the game.
