# Clean install run

A checklist for installing Thornswood on a machine that has never seen it, the
way a stranger would, with the time and every word on screen written down.

**Last run: never.**

Until somebody has walked it once on a clean virtual machine and filled in
every row, this is a plan and not a record, and the right assumption is that
something in it is wrong. The run is how to find out which part. It is held to
the same standard as `docs\RESTORING.md`.

## Why

Nobody has installed Thornswood on a clean machine and written down what
happened. Everybody who builds it already has Steam, Skyrim, Vortex, the
collection and an old install on their disk, so every step that only a stranger
meets goes untested. `installer\setup\Bootstrap.cs` and `installer\Setup-Thornswood.ps1`
are over 1,700 lines of installer, and the first person to run them on a
machine without all of that is a new tester. One run finds most of what that
person would, before they do.

## The shape being tested

The one that ships today. It has three parts, and a run that reaches a lit PLAY
button has been through all three.

1. The installer on the Downloads page fetches Thornswood's own files and puts
   them into the Steam copy of Skyrim. Its payload is built with everything the
   collection provides left out, and it carries a `collection.txt` that tells
   `installer\Setup-Thornswood.ps1` to install into the Steam copy rather than make
   a Skyrim of its own (`scripts\release\Package-Thornswood.ps1`).
2. Vortex deploys the Nexus collection into that same Steam copy.
3. The launcher makes Thornswood's own game folder, `C:\Thornswood\Game`, out
   of what Vortex deployed: the big files as hard links, so the collection is
   not on the disk twice, and copies of everything that gets rewritten in
   place. Then it restarts into that folder (`launcher\app\OwnGame.cs`,
   `launcher\app\ShellOwnGame.cs`). This is the settled design in CLAUDE.md, and
   the launcher will not start the game out of the shared Steam copy at all.

The To Do entry that asked for this list named the Steam copy with Vortex as the
shape to test, on the grounds that the own folder had not reached main. It has:
CLAUDE.md was corrected on 18 Sep, and the own folder is where a new install
ends up.

Row 20 settles which shape the downloaded installer really is. For this shape
the setup console says `Thornswood installs into this copy.` If it says
`This folder will be read from only.` instead, the installer on the site is the
older standalone shape. Write that down and stop, because the rest of this list
describes something that download does not do.

## Who does what

- **The tester** walks the rows and fills them in: Djinn, or anybody who has
  never installed Thornswood. Read this file through once before starting.
  Every question asked about it goes under Questions asked, because each one is
  a line this file is missing.
- **Patrick** accepts the Discord application at row 14, and runs the two checks
  at rows 48 and 49 on his own machine. One of them reads the server over SSH
  with his key, and that key never goes into a test machine.
- **Nobody fixes anything during the run.** Do only what the site, the installer
  or the launcher tells a person to do. When none of them says what to do next,
  that is the finding: write it down and stop the run there. The Address Library
  is the most likely to be missing. Record it, and do not add it by hand.

## Before the run

**The machine.**

- Hyper-V on the machine that hosts the run. Windows 11 Pro has it; Microsoft's
  page on switching it on is
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/Install-Hyper-V
- A generation 2 virtual machine with its virtual TPM switched on, since
  Windows 11 will not install without one, 8 GB of memory or more, and a single
  virtual disk of 200 GB, dynamically expanding. One disk on purpose: the own
  folder is made of hard links, and those only work inside one drive
  (`WhyNot` in `launcher\app\OwnGame.cs`). The size is generous so that running
  out of room is not what the run finds by accident. Row 46 measures what was
  really used.
- Room on the host for that disk. Measured on 24 Sep, C: on Patrick's machine
  had 2.6 GB free and D: and E: reported none, so the virtual machine cannot
  live there until room is made. If it goes on another machine instead, carry
  the `C:\ts-clean-run` folder M7 makes across to Patrick's machine for rows 48
  and 49.
- Windows 11 from Microsoft's own ISO, not a developer image, which comes with
  tools a stranger's machine does not have. Run Windows Update until it has
  nothing left, shut down, and take a checkpoint named `clean`. Every run
  starts from that checkpoint.
- Connect with an enhanced session and the host's C: drive shared in (Show
  Options, Local Resources, More, Drives). Row 47 copies the results out
  that way.
- No graphics card is needed. The run stops at the launcher's Play page, before
  the game starts.

**The outside.** The day of the run, Patrick runs `.\scripts\dev\Check-Outside.ps1`
from the repo folder on his own machine. It only reads, sends no token, and
walks what a first install fetches from outside the project: the update feed,
every pack, the launcher, the client runtime, Steam's public build and the
collection page. Keep what it prints with the run's screenshots. A red line
there is a row the run should expect to fail.

**The accounts.** Name each one in the rows. Never write down a password, a code
from an email or an authenticator, or anything a site or the launcher shows as
a key.

- A Steam account made for this run that owns Skyrim Special Edition. Owning it
  is a purchase.
- A Nexus Mods account made for this run, free, without Premium, because that
  is what a stranger has. On a free account Vortex can ask for a click on the
  Nexus site for every mod in the collection, and row 33 counts them.
- A Discord account that has never been in the Thornswood server, so the
  application is walked too. Staff remove it afterwards.

**The record.** Fill in this file itself, on a branch, as the run goes. A second
screen or a printout works, with the rows copied in afterwards. Screenshots go
in one folder named after the date, and a Seen cell can name one ("shot 07")
when the text is too long to type.

## How to fill in a row

- **Clock**: the time of day when the step starts, 24 hour, to the minute, as
  in `14:05`. How long a step took is the gap to the next row. A row the run
  never reached says `not reached`.
- **Seen, word for word**: every prompt, warning, error and button the step put
  on screen, copied exactly, window title included, and the numbers: sizes,
  speeds, counts. A row where nothing appeared says `nothing`.
- **A stranger would instead**: what somebody holding only the join page would
  have done at this point, where that is different from the step. Blank when it
  is the same.

The commands the measuring rows name (M1 to M8, C1 and C2) are under Commands,
further down. On the virtual machine they go into Windows PowerShell, from the
Start menu.

## The run

### The machine

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Start the virtual machine from the `clean` checkpoint and sign in to Windows. Write down the version `winver` shows. | | | |
| 2 | Measure the free space on C: before anything is installed (M1). | | | |
| 3 | Open https://thornswood.net/join in Edge and read it once, through. Under Seen, write the steps the tester now believes they have to take, in their order, before taking any. The page says the Steam copy can stay on any build: the launcher's Downgrade button asks Steam for 1.6.1170's files and puts them in Thornswood's own folder, and leaves the Skyrim you already have alone. | | | |

### Steam and Skyrim

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | Download Steam from https://store.steampowered.com and install it. | | | |
| 5 | Sign in to Steam with the account made for this run. Name the account; never the password or a Steam Guard code. | | | |
| 6 | Put Skyrim Special Edition on that account. | | | |
| 7 | Install Skyrim Special Edition into Steam's own library on C:. Write down the size Steam shows and when it finished. | | | |
| 8 | Measure which build Steam installed (M2). | | | |
| 9 | Do not start Skyrim: the join page never says to. Write down here, and at the row where it happens, anything later that asks for it to have been started once. | | | |

### Nexus and Vortex

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | Make a Nexus Mods account for this run, free, without Premium. Name the account; never the password. | | | |
| 11 | Download Vortex from Nexus Mods and install it. | | | |
| 12 | Sign Vortex in to Nexus Mods and let it find and manage Skyrim Special Edition. | | | |

### Apply

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13 | Join the Thornswood Discord from the site and apply in a ticket, the way the join page says. | | | |
| 14 | Patrick accepts the application. Write down how long after the ticket that came. | | | |

### The installer

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15 | Open https://thornswood.net/downloads and download the installer. Write down the file name, its size, the SHA-256 the page prints under it, and every warning the browser shows. Then measure the downloaded file's SHA-256 (M8) and write down whether the two match. | | | |
| 16 | Run it. Write down the Windows warning word for word, and what had to be pressed to get past it. | | | |
| 17 | Read the setup window before pressing anything. Write down the folder it offers, the free space line under the drives, and the Installing from box. Also copy what it says about the Steam copy when Thornswood's own Skyrim folder is chosen: it does not install into the Skyrim you already have on Steam, and that copy is left as it is. | | | |
| 18 | Leave the folder at `C:\Thornswood`, tick the box that says 18 or over, and press Install. Write down the download's size, its speed and when it finished. | | | |
| 19 | Write down the unpacking count, and when the black setup console opened. | | | |
| 20 | Write down the console's first lines, up to the heading The base game, including whether it says Thornswood installs into this copy. If it says this Skyrim is not build 1.6.1170, write down what it says to do: open the launcher and press Downgrade, so Steam downloads 1.6.1170's files and Thornswood makes its own game folder from them, while the Steam copy stays on the build it is on. Do not change anything in Steam. | | | |
| 21 | Screenshot the console once it prints Checking, before it can close, and copy every line marked ok, next or MISS. | | | |
| 22 | Write down how the console ended: whether it opened the launcher itself or waited for Enter, and its last lines. | | | |

### The launcher's first look

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 23 | If the launcher did not open by itself, open Thornswood from the desktop. Write down the words on the Play button and every card above it. | | | |
| 24 | Write down every Windows prompt the launcher raised on its first start: firewall, microphone, administrator. | | | |
| 25 | Measure whether the installer's scratch folder is still on the disk now that the launcher has started (M3). | | | |

### The build

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 26 | Press Downgrade on the card. Copy the question it asks before anything starts, word for word, and what the tester chose. The question says the Steam copy of Skyrim is not changed and can stay on any build, and that the files go into Thornswood's own game folder. Then write down every window that opened, the log line that says it is getting Skyrim 1.6.1170, and whether the tester had to touch Steam at all. | | | |
| 27 | When the launcher says it is done, measure the build again (M2) and write down the build the Play page shows. | | | |
| 28 | The launcher does not ask about Steam's Updates after Downgrade, because the downgrade never changes the Steam copy. The question is asked on the way in, and only when Skyrim is already on 1.6.1170, Thornswood has no folder of its own yet, and Steam is open. If it appeared, copy it word for word and write down what the tester did with it. If a downgrade was needed first, write that the question did not appear. With Steam running, write down what Skyrim's Properties, Updates page shows under Automatic Updates, and whether Steam's Downloads page has Skyrim queued for an update again. | | | |

### Discord in the launcher

The join page puts this after the collection. The launcher's collection card
used to ask for it first and keep the collection shut until it was done; since
#428 the collection opens without it, because anyone can download in the alpha.
The list still takes it here, and row 30 records which order the tester really
took.

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 29 | Press Connect Discord where the launcher offers it. Write down the card's words first, then every page the browser showed, and whether it closed itself. | | | |
| 30 | Write down which the tester reached for first, the collection or Connect Discord, and why. | | | |

### The collection

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 31 | Open the collection from the launcher's card or from the Downloads page. Write down which, and the revision the Nexus page shows. | | | |
| 32 | Add it to Vortex and start the install. Write down every dialog, including the switch for skipping plugin rules, and leave that switch as it comes. | | | |
| 33 | Write down how many mods asked for a click on the Nexus site, and when the last one finished downloading. | | | |
| 34 | Write down the name of the Vortex profile the collection made, and whether Vortex switched to it by itself. | | | |
| 35 | Write down every dialog at deployment: external changes, file conflicts, sorting, missing masters. | | | |
| 36 | Measure whether the Address Library arrived in the Steam copy, and whether Start On Save did too (M4). Do not add or remove either by hand. | | | |

### Thornswood's own folder

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 37 | Go back to the launcher. Write down the words on the Play button and any question it asks, and press the button if it asks nothing. | | | |
| 38 | Answer yes to the question about a Skyrim folder of its own. Copy the whole question word for word, then the percentages the log shows, and how long it took. | | | |
| 39 | Write down any Windows prompt while the folder is made. There should be none: the launcher no longer asks for administrator for a firewall rule. | | | |
| 40 | Write down the restart, and copy the log line that starts "Thornswood's own Skyrim folder is ready at" (M5). | | | |
| 41 | Measure whether the Address Library is in the own folder and Start On Save is not (M4 again). | | | |
| 42 | Write down the Client row on the Play page, and any log lines about putting the client runtime back (M5). | | | |

### The Play page

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 43 | Write down any update the launcher offered, how many, and how long it took. | | | |
| 44 | Write down the line under the title (plugins, game build, launcher version), every check row, green or red, the bar above Play if there is one, and the First time card. | | | |
| 45 | The run ends when the Play button reads PLAY and can be pressed. Write down the time. Do not press it. | | | |
| 46 | Measure the free space on C: again (M1), and the size of `C:\Thornswood` (M6). | | | |

### The two read-only checks

| # | Step | Clock | Seen, word for word | A stranger would instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 47 | Copy the plugins, the load order and the launcher log out of the virtual machine (M7). | | | |
| 48 | On Patrick's machine, run Check-Build.ps1 against that copy (C1). Copy its In short line. | | | |
| 49 | On Patrick's machine, run Check-Manifest.ps1 against that copy (C2). Copy its POSITION BY POSITION line. | | | |

## Questions asked

Every question the tester asks, before or during the run, in their own words,
with the row it came up at.

| Row | The question |
| --- | --- |

## Commands

M1 to M8 run on the virtual machine. C1 and C2 run on Patrick's machine. All of
them only read, except M7, which copies files out of the virtual machine into
`C:\ts-clean-run` on Patrick's machine.

**M1, free space on C:.** Prints two numbers, used and free, in GB. The first
and last readings are the whole install's real cost on the disk.

```powershell
Get-PSDrive C | Select-Object @{ n = 'UsedGB'; e = { [math]::Round($_.Used / 1GB, 1) } }, @{ n = 'FreeGB'; e = { [math]::Round($_.Free / 1GB, 1) } }
```

**M2, which build of Skyrim.** Prints the size of SkyrimSE.exe in bytes.
37157144 is 1.6.1170, the build the server runs (`installer\Setup-Thornswood.ps1`).
37910440 is 1.7.104 (`launcher\app\Downgrade.cs`). Write any other number down as
it is.

```powershell
(Get-Item 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\SkyrimSE.exe').Length
```

**M3, the installer's scratch folder.** The first line prints True while
`C:\Thornswood-setup` is still there. The second prints the launcher's own line
from when it cleared the folder, and nothing if it has not.

```powershell
Test-Path C:\Thornswood-setup
Select-String -Path C:\Thornswood\Profile\launcher.log -Pattern 'the installer left behind' | ForEach-Object { $_.Line }
```

**M4, the Address Library and Start On Save.** Four lines, True or False: the
Steam copy first, then the own folder. Until row 38 the own folder does not
exist, so its two lines read False. Once it does, its Address Library line
should read True and its Start On Save line False: Start On Save left
Thornswood in issue #394 and the launcher keeps it out of the own folder, even
while a collection revision older than the one that dropped it still deploys it
into the Steam copy.

```powershell
foreach ($d in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\SKSE\Plugins', 'C:\Thornswood\Game\Data\SKSE\Plugins') {
  foreach ($f in 'versionlib-1-6-1170-0.bin', 'po3_StartOnSave.dll') {
    '{0,-5}  {1}' -f (Test-Path -LiteralPath (Join-Path $d $f)), (Join-Path $d $f)
  }
}
```

**M5, the launcher's own account of the folder and the client.** Prints the
matching lines from the launcher's log, each with its time.

```powershell
Select-String -Path C:\Thornswood\Profile\launcher.log -Pattern 'own Skyrim folder|Restarting the launcher|client runtime' | ForEach-Object { $_.Line }
```

**M6, the size of C:\Thornswood.** A hard linked file counts at its full size
here although it takes no extra room, so this reads larger than the folder
really costs. M1 is the real cost.

```powershell
'{0:n1} GB' -f ((Get-ChildItem C:\Thornswood -Recurse -File -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Measure-Object Length -Sum).Sum / 1GB)
```

**M7, copy the results out.** Puts the plugins at the top of the own folder's
Data, its Skyrim.ccc, the load order the game reads and the launcher's log into
`C:\ts-clean-run` on Patrick's machine, through the drive the enhanced session
shares in. Only the plugins, because the two checks read nothing else: on 24 Sep
Patrick's own game folder had 100 of them at the top of Data, 377 MB. robocopy
ends with a summary table, and any number under Failed means a file did not come
across.

```powershell
$out = '\\tsclient\C\ts-clean-run'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$out\Game\Data", "$out\Profile\LocalAppData" | Out-Null
robocopy C:\Thornswood\Game\Data "$out\Game\Data" *.esm *.esp *.esl /LEV:1 /NFL /NDL /NJH
if (Test-Path C:\Thornswood\Game\Skyrim.ccc) { Copy-Item C:\Thornswood\Game\Skyrim.ccc "$out\Game\" }
Copy-Item C:\Thornswood\Profile\LocalAppData\plugins.txt "$out\Profile\LocalAppData\"
Copy-Item C:\Thornswood\Profile\launcher.log "$out\"
```

**M8, the installer's checksum.** Prints the SHA-256 of the newest installer in
the Downloads folder, in lower case the way the Downloads page prints it, then
the file it read. An installer published before the page printed a checksum has
none there, and then row 15 says so. A checksum is not a key: the page prints it
for anybody, so both go into row 15 whole, and
`tests\test-clean-install-run.js` lets a SHA-256 through on a line that says
SHA-256.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\Thornswood-Setup*.exe" | Sort-Object LastWriteTime | Select-Object -Last 1 | Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 | ForEach-Object { $_.Hash.ToLower() + '  ' + $_.Path }
```

**C1 and C2, the two read-only checks, on Patrick's machine.** The first line
goes to the repo folder.

```powershell
cd C:\Thornswood-Repo
.\scripts\release\Check-Build.ps1 -Data C:\ts-clean-run\Game\Data -NoPause
.\scripts\mods\Check-Manifest.ps1 -Client C:\ts-clean-run -NoPause
```

C1 reads the live server's manifest over HTTP and compares every plugin it
names, by size and checksum, with the copy. When it worked it prints
`This build is byte for byte what the server expects.` above a line reading
0 missing and 0 the wrong file, and it exits 2 when anything is missing or
wrong.

C2 reads the live server's load order over SSH and compares it, position by
position, with the copy's plugins.txt. When it worked it prints
`you have every plugin the server wants` and
`POSITION BY POSITION: identical.`

Both check the live server, because the installer on the Downloads page is the
main build. Both need their `-Data` and `-Client`: without them they read
Patrick's own `C:\Thornswood` and pass for the wrong reason.

## What the build should show, by row

For whoever reads the filled-in rows afterwards, not for the tester during the
run: a tester who knows what is coming is not a stranger any more. Each line is
text the build puts on screen at that row, copied from the file named beside it.
`tests\test-clean-install-run.js` checks that every one of them is still in that
file, so a label that changes shows up as a stale line here rather than as a
tester confused by a list that no longer matches.

## What the code predicts

Read out of the code before anybody has run it, so the run can prove each one
right or wrong. To Do entries are named by title, because their numbers move.

- **The setup console may call a good install broken (rows 21 and 22).** In
  this shape `installer\Setup-Thornswood.ps1` finishes with six checks and excuses
  two of them, the script extender and the Address Library, as things the
  collection brings next. The other four count. Game 1.6.1170 reads the Steam
  copy, which Steam has just installed on a newer build, and Load order looks
  for a plugins.txt under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Skyrim Special Edition`, which nothing
  may have written yet on a machine where Skyrim has never started and the
  collection is not in. Either one fails, and then the console says the checks
  failed, tells the person to send staff a screenshot, waits for Enter, and does
  not open the launcher. No To Do entry covers this yet.
- **Two different ways to fix the build (rows 20 and 26).** The console says to
  pick 1.6.1170 under Betas in Steam. The launcher and the join page use the
  Downgrade button, which asks Steam for the old build through Steam's console.
  Row 20 records whether Steam's Betas list offers 1.6.1170 at all. Since
  24 Sep the button asks first, naming the three lines it will type into
  Steam's console, so row 26 starts with a Yes or No. The keystrokes
  themselves are still owned by "Downgrade drives Valve's own window by
  synthesised keystrokes at a measured pixel offset, with no consent screen".
  The two instructions disagreeing has no entry.
- **Steam taking Skyrim back to the newer build (row 28).** Once a downgrade
  has worked, the launcher asks whether to set Skyrim's Automatic Updates in
  Steam to "Wait until I launch the game", and asks for Steam to be exited
  first, because Steam writes its own setting back when it closes. No leaves
  it as it is. Either way Steam still updates the game when it is started from
  Steam. Owned by "Nothing stops Steam putting Skyrim back on the wrong build".
- **"It does not make a second copy of the game" (rows 3 and 17).** Fixed on
  25 September: the setup window, the join page, the help page, READ ME FIRST
  and the home page now say the launcher builds `C:\Thornswood\Game`, most of
  it as hard links, and leaves your own Skyrim alone.
- **Other servers, on a machine that has none (rows 23 and 38).** A log line on
  the first start and the own folder question both say Thornswood is sharing one Skyrim
  with other servers. On a clean machine there are none, and a stranger reads
  that as something they did wrong. No entry.
- **Three different orders (rows 22, 23, 29 and 30).** The join page says
  installer, collection, then Discord. The console says the launcher opens on
  the collection. The launcher opens on Downgrade instead, keeps the collection
  card hidden until the build is right, and then asks for Discord before it will
  open the collection. No entry.
- **The console's last word is out of date (rows 22 and 44).** When every check
  passes it ends with "Make a character named after yourself, save once, then
  connect." The join page says the game asks at its main menu which character
  to be, and since 24 Sep the launcher's First time card asks for a name that
  belongs in Skyrim and not your own, and says nothing about saving. So the
  console now disagrees with the launcher it opens. No entry.
- **The Address Library and Start On Save (rows 36 and 41).** The Address
  Library is expected missing unless the collection delivers it, owned by "The
  launcher never checks the Address Library, so a whole class of failure reads
  as green". Start On Save in the own folder is a finding against issue #394,
  which took it out.
- **SmartScreen (row 16).** Owned by "Nothing is code signed: SmartScreen warns
  forever, and one GitHub login is all that stands between a stranger and every
  installed machine".
- **Updates on the first open (row 43).** An installer older than the last
  release offers what came after it. One built with no record of the packs it
  already holds offers every pack ever published, and `scripts\dev\Check-Outside.ps1`
  found on 24 Sep that 164 of the feed's 227 packs point at a repository a
  stranger cannot download from. Owned by "The installer is a snapshot of your
  game folder with your home folder path baked into the script, and it is
  stale by design".
- **Play held by the feed (rows 44 and 45).** The update feed can now put a
  bar above Play and hold Play for maintenance or for a launcher too old to
  play. If row 45 never reaches PLAY because of it, copy the bar word for word
  and stop there.
- **The client runtime is left out of the own folder on purpose (row 42).** The
  own folder never takes the six client files from the Steam copy (`Skip` in
  `launcher\app\OwnGame.cs`), so right after the restart the Client row should read
  missing, and the launcher should put them back by itself
  (`HealClientBackground` in `launcher\app\Shell.cs`). Row 42 records whether it
  did and how long it took.
- **The load order matches the server (row 49).** This is the proof owed by "The
  Nexus collection carries the plugin order from revision 5, and what is left is
  proving a clean install matches the server".
- **An old README in the scratch folder (row 25).** The installer unpacks into
  `C:\Thornswood-setup` with a READ ME FIRST.txt that still describes the old
  multiplayer mod's installer and says no Nexus account or Vortex is needed. The launcher
  clears the folder on its first start (`launcher\app\Shell.cs`), so a stranger only
  meets it if they look before then. Owned by "The repository's own docs still
  describe the old product".

## After the run

1. Change the Last run line at the top to the date, who walked it, and which
   checkpoint it started from.
2. Every row whose Seen differs from What the build should show, and every
   question asked, goes on the To Do List: into the entry named above where one
   fits, as a new entry where none does.
3. Correct this file wherever a row could not be followed as it was written.
4. Run `node tests\test-clean-install-run.js`. Once the Last run line carries a
   date it fails on any row left without a time and an observation.
5. Open a pull request with the filled-in file.

## Shrinking the list next time

- Take a second checkpoint after row 12, named `steam-and-vortex`. Steam,
  Skyrim and Vortex are not ours, and once they have been timed from nothing a
  run that only tests what is ours can start there and say so on its Last run
  line.
- M1 to M6 and M8 can become one script that writes its answers to a file, so
  the measuring rows are pasted rather than typed. `scripts\dev\Check-Outside.ps1`
  already scripts the outside half: what the feed, GitHub, Steam and Nexus
  answer a stranger.
- The setup console keeps no record of itself, which is why rows 20 to 22 lean
  on a screenshot taken in time. A transcript in `C:\Thornswood\Profile` would
  make those rows a copy.
- The rest stays by hand. Every prompt, warning and wait in it is what a
  stranger meets, and timing that is the reason for the run.
