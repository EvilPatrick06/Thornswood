"""
test-staff-gate.py

Every staff and admin command the bot has, run as somebody who is not staff
for it, and refused (issue #1342).

The audit said some admin commands had no staff role check. Measured on
5 October, every command does have a gate: /close and the Close ticket button
answer to is_staff, and /test-task (the four /live-smoke commands until
11 October) to is_task_poster.
The hole was inside is_staff, which also let in anybody the channel trusted
with threads. On the server Build-Discord.py makes, that is Lead Gamemaster
and Trial Gamemaster, whose GM permissions carry Manage Threads on every
channel, and neither is a staff role. Both could close any ticket and skip
the ticket limits.

This holds all of it in place:

  1. Every slash command, context menu and persistent button the bot
     registers is listed below with the gate it answers to. One that is not
     listed, a new command or a new panel, fails here until it is written in
     with its gate.
  2. Every staff and admin one is run the way Discord runs it, through its
     checks and then its callback, as people who are not staff for it, and
     must answer with a refusal only that person sees and do nothing else.
  3. The same callbacks let the right people through, a staff role matched
     by its id after a rename included, so a gate that refuses everybody does
     not pass for a gate.

The real bot module is imported. Only what touches Discord is replaced: the
server, the channels, the ticket thread and the interaction, and the file of
open tickets, which is pointed at a temporary folder.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
