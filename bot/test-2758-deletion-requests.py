test-2758-deletion-requests.py

A deletion request is taken out of the bot's own records as it starts
(#2758). scripts\\vps\\Delete-Person.ps1 stops nothing: it writes
deletion-requests.json into the bot's data folder, and bot.py takes it out
of joins.json and open-tickets.json before it connects (Patrick, 18 Oct
2026: "it should just fully apply the rest upon a server restart").

This runs the real apply_deletion_requests on a scratch data folder:
their join number and open ticket go and the last number given out stays,
everybody else's stay, the request is deleted and the log line names no id;
a record that will not parse leaves the request waiting and changes
nothing; a request that is not one is left as it is; and the main guard
takes the request before client.run.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
