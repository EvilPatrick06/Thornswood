"""
test-watch-services.py

The bot saying in the staff channel what the VPS watchdog says has died, and
when it is back (issue #447).

Since #447 the watchdog decides: one message when a thing goes down, one when
it is back, however long it stays down and however often it flaps. It writes
them to alerts.jsonl, and tests\\test-watch-alerts.ps1 proves the counting.
The bot only delivers, so what is worth testing here is that it delivers each
message ONCE: not again on its next read, not again after a restart, not again
after the watchdog's webhook said it while the bot was down, and not a day
late. And that it never says anything anywhere but the staff channel, found by
id: this server has a public channel with the same name.

The outbox it reads here is one the real watchdog wrote: this runs
test-watch-alerts.ps1 -Emit, which drives the watcher out of
Watch-Services.ps1 against fakes, so a change to the shape of a message on
either side fails here rather than going quiet on the box.

The real bot module is imported and the real coroutine is run against real
files in a temporary folder. Only Discord and the sleep are replaced.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
