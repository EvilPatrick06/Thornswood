"""
test-ready.py

Startup does the one-off things once, and the panel is read before it is
written.

From the To Do List: "on_ready re-registers views, re-syncs commands and
re-edits the panel on every reconnect... On a flaky evening the bot is one of
the things making the evening worse for itself, and a rate-limited sync writes
a traceback the log viewer then hides."

on_ready is not a startup hook. It fires every time the gateway connection
drops and comes back, which is exactly when Discord is already unhappy, and
every one of those was three writes to Discord that changed nothing plus an
edit to the ticket panel.

The real bot module is imported and the real coroutine is run. Only the things
that touch Discord are replaced: the guild list, the command tree's three
calls, and the stamp file, which is pointed at a temporary folder so this
cannot touch the one beside the code.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
