test-5199-pr-tasks.py

The pull request's check on its test tasks (#5199, bot/pr_tasks.py): it
reads the "Test task for #N" blocks the way .github/workflows/done-on-merge.yml
does, and holds each against the bot's own post rules before the merge.

It holds:
  - the grammar is done-on-merge.yml's: the same three patterns are in that
    workflow's text, a block ends where that workflow ends one (a heading, a
    "---" line, an emoji line, the next block), and Dev is decided the same way;
  - a good Main and a good Dev test task pass, and so does a body with none;
  - each post rule is refused before the merge: a long title, no Server line,
    a link, code, a footer, unnumbered steps, a Dev step a workflow could do,
    ordinary steps marked Dev, a staff command in a Main one;
  - a Main body longer than the bot's first post, two of one kind for one
    issue, and a body that also closes the issue are refused;
  - with an issue reader: a missing issue, a pull request and a closed issue
    are refused, and an open issue passes;
  - main() exits 1 on a bad body and 0 on a good one, and says when it could
    not read the issues;
  - with a token it reads the body from GitHub, by number or through the one
    open pull request a branch heads, and passes a branch with none.

The real bot module is imported. Never connects to anything.
