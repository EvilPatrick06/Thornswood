test-3317-role-numbers.py

The role order Discord turned down (#3317).

The layout run of 22 Oct 2026, 3:22 PM box time, asked Discord to put the
roles in the plan's order in one request and Discord refused it whole: "the
roles were not put in order (400 Missing Permissions)". The read-only audit
from cfcefcea (#3317 comment 6351722611) measured why. The bot's highest role
is at position 110, but 125 roles sit under it, because Discord made the 16
Officer roles all at position 1, beside Updates Pings, and moved nothing up for
them. The build numbered its list 1 to 123, so it asked for positions 110 to
123, at or above the bot's own role, and Discord turns that down. Patreon and
Jockie Music, which their own bots manage, were left out of the list but
kept numbers in the middle of it.

This builds that server from the audit's own lines. The stand-in for Discord
does what Discord does: it refuses any position at or above the bot's role,
it lets positions repeat, and it sorts a shared position by id, older above.
This proves:

  N1 the old numbering, 1 to N, asks for positions at or above the bot's
     role on that server, and the stand-in refuses it the way Discord did
  N2 a build asks only for positions under the bot's role, in one request
  N3 afterwards every plan role is in the plan's order, Patreon included,
     and Jockie Music keeps its place
  N4 the build reads Discord's answer back and finds nothing out of place,
     and a second build asks for nothing
  N5 with room under the bot, every role gets a position of its own
  N6 roles that cannot fit even sharing positions are not asked for, and the
     run says why
  N7 rank sorts a shared position the way Discord does, older above, and
     order_slips sees a slip between two roles that share a position

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name, so its __main__
block never runs. Never connects to anything.
