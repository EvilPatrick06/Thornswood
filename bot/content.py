Nothing sexual involving minors, ever. Nothing graphic in the public channels.
Adult scenes between people who agreed to them beforehand are fine in private.
The full version of that is at **https://thornswood.net/rules**.

**3. Don't wreck somebody else's game.**
No cheating, no exploiting the server, no griefing. If you find something that
lets you break the world, tell us instead of using it. You'll get thanked.

**4. Don't pass the installer around.**
Send people here instead.

**5. Push to talk.**
An open mic with a fan behind it ruins voice for everyone in the room.

**6. Bugs in <#RESULTS>, ideas in <#SUGGESTIONS>.**
They get lost in general. That's not a rule so much as a favour to yourself.

**7. If a Moderator or a Gamemaster tells you to stop, stop.**
You can argue about it afterwards.

# Where you are

**Fourth Era, 252.** Fifty years since the war.

The Stormcloaks won it. The Legion marched out in the first thaw of 203 and the
Moot put the crown on Ulfric. He wore it twenty-six years and died in his
bed.

The Moot sat eleven days and didn't pick his kin. It picked **Eirik
Ravensgard** of the Rift, who's had it twenty-two years and is neither loved
nor hated.

There's a High King of Skyrim and nothing above him. Every hold keeps its own
Jarl, its own court, and its own opinion of everyone else's.

## The Thalmor

Thrown out in 209. Illegal ever since. Still here.

The ones who never made the border went to ground, and their grandchildren are
running gold and poison through the holds under other names. No orders from
home, no cause left, nobody to answer to. That's what makes them dangerous.

## The Empire

Came back in 221 with trade, because it couldn't come back with soldiers.

The White Harbour Accord traded grain for ore and got them one embassy in
Solitude and nothing else. The staff there are polite, and few in Skyrim
trust them.

## What you can play

A Nord out of any hold. An Imperial, legal and watched. A Thalmor remnant,
hunted by everyone including the Empire. A Jarl, a steward, a housecarl, a
guard, a priest, a smith, a hunter.

Not the Dragonborn. Not the Listener. Not the last of anything. Those belong to
the world.

## The rest

Full history and all nine articles of the Accord at
**https://thornswood.net/world**.

Article Four is the one people argue about in taverns: an Imperial standing on
Skyrim's soil is under Skyrim's law, a Nord standing in the embassy is under
the Empire's, and neither side can reach in and drag somebody out.
