"""
Draws the card that goes up when somebody joins.

Pillow only, and the background is a file rather than something generated at
runtime, so a join never waits on anything and a failure here can never stop
the greeting going out. bot.py falls back to plain text if this throws.

Names on Discord are dressed up: letters from the mathematical alphabets
(so MemeLordMaka arrives as bold script letters), fullwidth letters, circled
letters, and emoji on either end. The serif that draws the name has none of
those glyphs and on 2026-09-16 a card went up reading as a row of boxes. So
the name is folded back to ordinary letters first (NFKC does that in one
call), and whatever the serif still cannot draw is drawn from the system's
emoji font, then its symbol and CJK fonts, run by run along one baseline.
What no font knows is left out rather than drawn as a box, and a name with
nothing drawable left falls back to the account name.
