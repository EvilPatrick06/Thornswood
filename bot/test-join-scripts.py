"""
test-join-scripts.py

backfill.py and redraw.py give a member the number joins.json holds, and the
nightly backup takes joins.json.

Found by the join card fix (#318), 24 September: "backfill.py and redraw.py
are one-off scripts Install-Bot does not send. They still number by join
order among the members still here and do not read joins.json, so redraw.py
--all would redraw old cards with numbers that disagree with the record."
And: "vps-nightly-backup.ps1 takes only bot.env.json from the bot folder.
Backup-Server.ps1 takes the whole folder, so joins.json is only in that
backup."

Both scripts are imported for real, with discord.Client.run stood down while
they load so neither can connect even without its main guard, and their real
work() is run against a stand-in server: members with join dates, a welcome
channel holding the bot's cards, and card.render swapped for something that
writes down the number it was asked to draw. The record is put where bot.JOINS
points, in a temporary folder, and nowhere else, so a script only finds it by
going through bot.py; and its numbers are nothing like the join order, so a
card with the right number could only have read it.

The backup half runs the real vps-nightly-backup.ps1 under Windows
PowerShell, the shell the VPS runs it in, with every folder it reads or
writes pointed at a temporary one and -Plain, and opens the zip it makes.

Never connects to anything.
