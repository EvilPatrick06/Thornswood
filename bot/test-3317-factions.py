The sixteen factions in Discord (#3317).

Patrick, 22 Oct 2026, on the page: 16 factions (q-3317-faction-roster, B),
each with a member role and a Leader role (q-3317-faction-roles, A), the
Leader giving the member role (q-3317-faction-member-give, A), and every
faction's 4E 252 entry in lore/factions.md, which he approved the same day.
Later that day: "Factions are supposed to have their own invidual categories
like the holds", with "their own announcements, vcs, faction leaderships
channels", and its own seats channel with the Leader's buttons
(q-3317-faction-category, C: "One Officer role, not Court and Steward", in a
channel "called leadership since it's not a court"). This proves:

  F1 factions.json is the sixteen, and each has a member role (its short
     name), a Leader role and an Officer role, the Leader a seat and the
     rest not, and none of them ever deleted
  F2 the Trading Company role is renamed to the company's member role, so
     everybody holding it keeps it; Business Owner is in the plan
  F3 a category per faction, named after it, in the order of factions.json,
     after In Character and before the holds: announcements, chat,
     leadership, seats, voice; the chat and voice moved from Factions by name; Factions
     and #seats retired
  F4 a faction's chat and voice: its members, Leader and Officers
     talk; another faction's people, a Playtester, a Moderator and a Jarl get
     nothing; FACTION_STAFF talks; @everyone sees none
  F5 announcements: members read, the Leader, Officers and council post;
     leadership: the Leader and Officers talk, members do not; seats: the
     Leader and FACTION_STAFF read, members and Officers see nothing
  F6 lore/factions.md has an entry for every faction, by its short name

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name, so its __main__
block never runs. Read only. Never connects to anything.
