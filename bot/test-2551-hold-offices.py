test-2551-hold-offices.py

The hold offices are Discord roles (#2551). Patrick, 15 Oct:

  - Per hold the Discord builder makes "<Hold> Court", "Steward of <Hold>"
    and "Guard of <Hold>", keeps them in its never-delete list, and does not
    hoist them: only the Jarl and Citizen roles show separately.
  - That hold's Jarl gives and takes them from a bot panel with Add and
    Remove buttons that work only for their own hold, logged with who
    changed what.
  - If two accounts hold the same hold's Jarl role, neither acts as Jarl
    until staff fix it.
  - A change made in the game comes to staff the same way, through the
    site's moderation.log.

Holds:

  R1 every office role of every hold, Raven Rock's included (Patrick,
     16 Oct), is in the builder's role list, not hoisted, with plain
     permissions, and under the Citizen roles
  R5 Raven Rock has a Jarl role, hoisted like the others, and no Citizen
     role or hold channel, which nobody asked for
  E1 the running bot makes any Jarl or office role that is missing, the way
     it makes its ping roles, hoisted as the builder says, under the lowest
     Jarl or Citizen role, and touches none that is there
  R2 every one is in KEEP, with the Jarl and Citizen roles
  R3 the Jarl and Citizen roles are still hoisted, and nothing else in world is
  P1 the office panel is a persistent view of six buttons, Add and Remove for
     each office, and setup_hook registers it
  P2 its message is found again by its own buttons, and the hold panel's
     search passes over it
  O1 a press by somebody with no Jarl role is refused, only to them
  O2 the Jarl of Whiterun's Add asks who, and the pick gives the Steward of
     Whiterun role with the reason, says it to the Jarl and to staff
  O3 Remove offers the holders, and the pick takes the role back
  O4 the Jarl of Whiterun cannot change Riften's roles by any button
  O5 while two accounts hold the Jarl of Whiterun role, neither does anything
  O6 a bot is given nothing, and somebody already holding it is told so
  M1 the staff channel's line for a change in the game, for a clash and for
     the end of one, names who and what, and escapes what people typed

The builder and bot.py are imported for real, the builder under another name
so its __main__ block never runs. Read only. Never connects to anything.
