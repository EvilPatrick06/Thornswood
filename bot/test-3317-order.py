The sidebar in the plan's order, and the Voice category gone (#3317).

Patrick, 22 Oct 2026: "we need to delte the Voice category and proeprly move
each channel underntah it to it's proper channel, each hold needs a Court VC
... each Faction needs a VC, and we need to move the Help VC to under Support
and reanme it to SUpport and than the staff support vc to Support Staff", and
"better organize where each category goes on the left side" with "each
channel under every category is in an order that makes sense". This proves:

  O1 a server already in the plan's order is left alone
  O2 categories out of order are all put back, 0 up, in PLAN's order, and a
     category the plan does not name goes after them, as it was
  O3 a category's text channels are put back in the order its specs give,
     and its voices are not touched when they are already right
  O4 voices are ordered apart from text, as Discord draws them
  O5 -Check says what would move and writes nothing; a build sends every
     position in one request; a refusal is a failure, not a stop
  O6 the Voice category is retired and none of the plan; General, AFK and
     the jukebox are in Out of Character, moved by name; Help Voice becomes
     Support under Support; Support Voice becomes Support Staff
  O7 every hold has its Court voice and every faction its voice

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name, so its __main__
block never runs. Never connects to anything.
