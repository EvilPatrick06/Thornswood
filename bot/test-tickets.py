"""
test-tickets.py

One open ticket per person, and one new ticket every five minutes.

From the To Do List: "A public panel that auto-adds staff to every thread is
otherwise a free way to ping every moderator fifty times a minute". Before
this, picking from the panel sent the form and nothing else: no look at who
was asking, at what they already had open, or at when they last sent one.

The real bot module is imported, and the real TicketPicker.callback and
TicketModal.on_submit are run. Only what touches the world is replaced: the
guild, its channel and threads, the interaction, the push to the site, the
clock, and the file of open tickets, which is pointed at a temporary folder so
this cannot touch the one beside the code.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
