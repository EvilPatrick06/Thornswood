test-3317-faction-panel.py

A faction's Leader gives and takes its member role from a bot panel (#3317,
Patrick, 22 Oct, page card q-3317-faction-member-give, A). The same shape as
a Jarl's office panel (#2551):

Later the same day each faction got its own category, and in it its own
seats channel with the Leader's buttons for its members, its Court and its
Steward, the way a Jarl names a hold's (page card q-3317-faction-category,
A):

  P1 the panel is a persistent view of Add and Remove for the members (the
     custom ids the one shared panel had), the Court and the Steward, and
     setup_hook registers it; it is in each faction's #<faction>-seats, found
     again by its own buttons, and the old shared #seats panel is edited to
     say where the panels went, with no buttons
  P2 every role the bot gives is one Build-Discord.py makes, by the same
     name, for every faction in factions.json
  L1 a press by somebody who leads no faction is refused, only to them
  L2 the Companions Leader's Add asks who, and the pick gives Companions,
     with the reason in Discord's audit log; it is not said to staff
  L3 Remove offers who holds it, and the pick takes it back
  L4 the Companions Leader cannot give Thalmor by any button
  L5 while two accounts hold the Companions Leader role, neither does anything
  L6 a bot is given nothing, and somebody already holding it is told so
  L7 somebody leading two factions is asked which first
  S1 a press in #companions-seats is for the Companions, with no question;
     somebody who leads another faction is refused there
  S2 the Court and the Steward go only to a member, and taking somebody's
     membership takes their Court and Steward roles with it

The builder and bot.py are imported for real, the builder under another name
so its __main__ block never runs. Read only. Never connects to anything.
