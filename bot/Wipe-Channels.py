Wipe-Channels.py

One-off (#3336): deletes the messages of every channel in the Discord except the ones
that say how the place works. Patrick, 22 Oct 2026: "clean up and delete all
the messages in every channel in the discord besides rules, instructions,
documentation, known issues, and test tasks. Everything else can be deleted
we have already recorded all suggestions and all the test findings", and,
the same morning, both news channels and #staff-updates, so today starts
clean under the rules written since.

    python Wipe-Channels.py --env-file C:\\Thornswood-Bot\\bot.env.json
        says, channel by channel, what is kept and what would go, with how
        many messages and threads; deletes nothing
    python Wipe-Channels.py --env-file C:\\Thornswood-Bot\\bot.env.json --go
        deletes it

KEPT, whole, threads and all:
  - a channel whose name has rules, known-issues, test-tasks, instructions
    or documentation in it (#rules, #game-rules, #gm-rules, #known-issues,
    #test-tasks, #dev-test-tasks, #test-tasks-archive, and any channel of
    those words a new layout makes);
  - the channels that are the instructions and documentation: #welcome,
    #start-here, #faq, #lore, the ticket panel's channel
    (#tickets-and-applications, #applications) and #choose-your-hold;
  - the records, unless --wipe-records: the staff log of closed tickets
    (#tickets, #ticket-log in the #3317 layout) and #gm-discipline, which
    Patrick chose to keep on 22 Oct. A ticket is a private thread off the
    panel's channel, so open applications and the closed tickets the privacy
    page keeps for 365 days stay with it;
  - --keep NAME, as many as wanted, for anything else.

EVERYTHING ELSE goes: every message in every text, announcement and voice
channel, and every thread, open or archived, public or private, including
every post in a forum. Both #news channels and #staff-updates included. In a
channel that goes, these of the bot's stay: its panels (buttons or a menu),
which it only edits and its views answer; the doc it pinned; and a channel's
Changelog thread with the line that opens it, the record of what its doc
said (#3336: the first run took #news's).

Messages younger than two weeks go a hundred at a time; Discord deletes an
older one only by itself, so a channel with years of chat takes a while.
discord.py waits out each rate limit on its own.

It logs in over HTTP only, never the gateway, so the running bot keeps its
one session and nothing it does is disturbed. It reads DISCORD_TOKEN, from
--env-file the way bot.py --env-file does, and prints no secret. It posts
nothing anywhere. Run it on the box, in the bot's folder, with the bot's
python, the same as backfill.py.

  --only NAME   only that channel (as many as wanted): for a first, small run
  --go          deletes; without it nothing is deleted

Exit 0 when everything planned went (or, without --go, could be read), 1
when a channel or a message could not be read or deleted, each one named.
