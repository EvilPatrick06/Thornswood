Apply: Faction Leader replaced Apply: Trading Company.

The real bot module is imported and the real TicketModal.on_submit is
run. Only what touches Discord is replaced: the guild, its channels,
threads and roles, the interaction, and the push to the site.

Holds:

  the faction pick and Other on the form
  a submit-time recheck that a tampered pick is flagged and Other is not
  the seat rule on both Faction Leader and Jarl: staff are refused (#3317)
  only the open seats offered
  typed Other text out of the pinging opening line and Asking for
  Faction Leader routing to Owner and UPPER_STAFF_ROLES only
  /close on those threads for UPPER_STAFF_ROLES IDs, without changing is_staff
  delete of the exact opened thread when a later write fails

Read only. Never connects to anything.
