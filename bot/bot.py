"""
The Thornswood bot. This one stays running, unlike Build-Discord.py which sets
the server up once and exits.

What it does:

  Joins    draws a card and puts it in #welcome
  Tickets  a panel in #tickets-and-applications, one private thread per
           ticket, and a copy pushed to the site so the inbox has it whether
           or not anybody was looking at Discord. #tickets is the staff only
           channel closed tickets are written down in, and where a ticket
           goes when its thread will not open
  Services posts in the staff channel what the VPS watchdog says has died
           and when it is back, from its outbox, once each (issue #447)
  Reports  says each thing sent in on the site's public report page in the
           staff channel, the day it arrives
  Holds    a panel in #choose-your-hold where a Member picks their hold
           and which announcements ping them
  Testing  #known-issues is a forum with one post per open GitHub issue
           labelled Dev Findings or Main Findings; the post goes when the
           issue is closed, which is when its fix is on main. #test-tasks is a
           forum of test tasks: one for each issue closed as fixed (its "Test
           task:" comment), always tagged Main, because main is where testers
           test, plus any posted by hand tagged Main (/test-task,
           python bot.py --post-task). #dev-test-tasks, a staff only forum
           in Staff, holds the test tasks whose comment says "Server: Dev":
           a measurement someone on dev has to take, open issue or closed,
           and any posted by hand tagged Dev. The same read writes the
           site's Known Issues page (the #known-issues list) and its
           roadmap (the "roadmap:" labels) for the site to show (#3140).
           The channels get there once, by hand, with
           python bot.py --setup-channels [--apply] (the testing channels
           section below)
  Heartbeat writes heartbeat.json beside this file every minute, so the
           watchdog can tell a bot that is running from one that is on
           Discord (issue #449)
  Uptime   pings an outside monitor every minute while it is on Discord, so
           a bot or a VPS that stops is noticed from outside the box (#449)

Everything it needs is in env:

  DISCORD_TOKEN    the bot token
  THORNSWOOD_SITE  https://thornswood.net
  THORNSWOOD_KEY   shared secret the site checks on /api/ticket
  JOIN_CHANNEL     name of the channel join cards go in, default general
  TICKET_CHANNEL   public channel the panel lives in, comma separated, first wins
  TICKET_LOG       staff only channel closed tickets are recorded in, and where
                   a ticket goes when its thread will not open. Checked by its
                   permissions, never trusted by its name
  STAFF_ROLES      comma separated role IDs (preferred) or names, who gets
                   pulled into every ticket thread

                   ID and each department Lead ID (today Lead Gamemaster).
                   Names are ignored and logged. Empty or unset means a
                   Faction Leader ticket is refused: nobody else is added,
                   and the applicant is told to try again later.
  TICKET_COOLDOWN  seconds between one person's tickets, default 300
  WATCH_CHANNEL_ID id of the staff channel the watchdog's messages go in,
                   default whatever staff-channel.txt beside this file
                   holds, #staff-updates. Leave it unset

  GITHUB_TOKEN     token for the repository's issues, read and write: the
                   rule comments and Report a problem (#3155) write. A
                   secret, set only in bot.env.json. Not set means no
                   #known-issues posts and no problems filed
  PROBLEM_LABELS   labels a filed problem gets, default Tester report,area: triage
  PROBLEM_CHANNEL  channel the Report a problem panel lives in, default

  HEARTBEAT_FILE   where the heartbeat goes, default heartbeat.json beside this
                   file, which is where the watchdog reads it
  HEARTBEAT_EVERY  seconds between heartbeats, default 60
  PING_URL         the outside monitor's ping address. A secret, set only by
                   Install-Bot.ps1 -SetPing and never written to the log. Not
                   set means no ping
  PING_EVERY       seconds between pings, default 60
  PING_TIMEOUT     seconds one ping may take, default 10

It is written to keep going when a piece of it fails. A card that will not
draw still gets a greeting, a site that is down still gets a thread, and a
thread that cannot be made still gets an answer to the person who asked.

# unlike the webhook files next to it, so the id is not a secret. Install-Bot

#
# NOT dev-channel.txt. That one is the dev updates channel, where dev releases
# are announced, and only Set-DevNews.ps1 reads it, to check the dev release
# webhook. The watchdog read it until 12 Oct (#2501), from a comment here that

# at that moment, and the size falls whenever anybody leaves or is removed, so
# one departure between two joins handed the second arrival the first one's

#
# So the numbers are written down: the last one given out on each server, and
# the one each person got. A new arrival gets the next one, and somebody who
# leaves and comes back keeps theirs. It never goes below member_count, since
# anybody who joined while the bot was down was never counted here. And it
# never goes below JOIN_FLOOR, the highest number known to be on a card
# already: 28, off that screenshot, which is the one number the first join
# after this goes up has to get past, with no record yet and a member count
# that may by then be under it. Set JOIN_NUMBER_FLOOR in bot.env.json on the
# VPS if a later card went higher before this was installed.

# they are Discord roles ("<Hold> Court", "Steward of <Hold>", "Guard of
# <Hold>", made by Build-Discord.py and never hoisted). That hold's Jarl gives
# and takes them, two ways, for their own hold only: here, with Add and Remove
# buttons, and in the game on the Office page of K, where the site sets the
# same roles with this bot's token. The role is the one truth either way, so
# nothing here or in the game keeps a list of who holds what.
#
# A Jarl is whoever holds that hold's "Jarl of <Hold>" role. If two accounts
# hold the same one, neither acts as Jarl here until staff take it from all
# but one (Patrick, 15 Oct); the site tells staff which accounts, through the
# staff log, the moment it sees it.
#
# The panel is a second message in #choose-your-hold, under the hold panel,
# found again by its own buttons. Every change is said in the staff channel
# (report_say), with who changed what, and Discord's audit log keeps it with
# the reason. Changes made in the game come to the staff channel the same way,
# through the site's moderation.log (watch_moderation, office_text).

# faction's Leader gives and takes its member role from a bot panel. The
# member role is the faction's short name ("Thalmor", "Companions"), made by
# Build-Discord.py with its "<short name> Leader" role, and the Leader is
# whoever holds that role. Like a Jarl's offices: their own faction only, and
# when two accounts hold one Leader role neither acts until staff take it
# from all but one.
#
# Patrick, 22 Oct, later: "seats should be in a different channel like how
# the holds have the add member add court add a steward so one for each
# faction in it's category", and on page card q-3317-faction-category, C:
# "One Officer role, not Court and Steward". So each faction has its own
# category, and in it its own seats channel with this panel: Add and Remove
# for its members and its Officers ("<short> Officer"). The faction is the
# channel's. The shared #seats it was in until then is retired; its old panel
# says where the panels went until -Prune deletes it.
#
# A change goes in bot.log and in Discord's audit log with its reason; it is
# not said to staff, because staff have nothing to do about it (Patrick,

# ------------------------------------------------------- testing channels --
#
# Patrick's card of 11 October. The Live smoke checklist that lived in
# #test-tasks (dated sessions, Pass/Fail/Skip/Fail-known rows, /live-smoke)
# is gone, and the testing channels are three things instead:
#
#   #test-tasks     a Forum. One thread per test task, tagged Main: the
#                   bot posts one, tagged Main, for each issue closed as fixed
#                   (see known issues below), and staff can post one by hand
#                   (/test-task, or python bot.py --post-task), tagged Main.
#   #test-findings  what #test-results was, renamed. Nothing else about it moves.
#   #known-issues   a Forum, read only: one bot post per open GitHub issue
#                   labelled Dev Findings or Main Findings, title only, no
#                   number and no link. The post goes when the issue is closed,
#                   which is when its fix is on main (Patrick, 11 Oct: one
#                   entry per issue, not one list).
#   #dev-test-tasks a Forum in Staff, staff only (Patrick, 12 Oct): the test
#                   tasks someone on dev has to measure, from comments that
#                   say "Server: Dev" (see known issues below), and staff
#                   can post one by hand (/test-task with the tag Dev, or
#                   --post-task --tag Dev). Most go to #test-tasks, because
#                   testers play on main in the alpha.
#
# THE ONE-TIME SETUP. Getting the server from the old shape to that one is the
# only channel change the bot makes, and Patrick's explicit exception to the
# never-touch-channels rule, for these three changes only. It runs only when
# asked, from the command line, never on a normal start:
#
#   python bot.py --setup-channels            says what it would do, changes nothing
#   python bot.py --setup-channels --apply    does it, once
#
# A finished apply is written to channel-setup.json in the data folder, and a
# second run reads it and does nothing at all. Each step also looks at the
# server before it acts, so an apply that stopped half way picks up where it
# stopped. Permission overwrites are copied, never invented.
#
# Discord cannot turn a text channel into a forum (a channel's type can only go
# between text and announcement). The edit is asked for anyway, in case that
# changes, and when Discord refuses it a new forum called test-tasks is made in
# the same category, at the same position, with the old channel's overwrites,
# and the old one is renamed test-tasks-archive with sending switched off for
# everyone but the bot. Nothing is deleted.
#
# #dev-test-tasks is the third one-time step (Patrick, 12 Oct), on a server
# that already had the first two: the forum is made in the category whose id
# is DEV_TASKS_CATEGORY, with that category's overwrites copied, so the same
# staff see it, and the bot's own forum rights from #test-tasks. Its id is
# written to channel-setup.json as dev_tasks_id, and from then on the bot
# finds it by that id and never by its name, so a rename keeps it and no
# second one is made. A forum of that name already in the category (made by
# hand or by Build-Discord.py) is taken as it is and its id recorded.

# ---------------------------------------------------------- known issues --
#
# Patrick, 11 Oct: the issue board is not where testers look. Two forums are
# kept from it, automatically, as things are found and fixed:
#
#   #known-issues  one post per open issue labelled Dev Findings or Main
#                  Findings, tagged Dev or Main by its labels (where it was
#                  found). The post goes the moment its issue is no longer an
#                  open finding: fixed and closed, closed any other way, or its
#                  label taken off.
#   #test-tasks    one post per issue closed as fixed from the day this began
#                  (see the since stamp below), for testers to check. Its
#                  title and body are the issue's last comment that starts
#                  "Test task:" (written by whoever fixed it); a finding with
#                  no such comment gets its own title and a plain line. An
#                  issue that is reopened loses its test task, and comes back
#                  to #known-issues if it is still a finding.
#
# When an issue closes (Patrick, 11 Oct): dev is where the team checks that
# nothing breaks the game, and main is where testers test, since we are in
# alpha. So a fix people would notice is closed, with its "Test task:"
# comment, when it reaches main, not when it merges or reaches dev, and every
# test task the bot posts in #test-tasks is tagged Main. A "Server:" line
# under "Known issue:" still sets that post's tag.
#
#   #dev-test-tasks (Patrick, 12 Oct) one post per issue whose last "Test
#                  task:" comment has "Server: Dev" straight under it, open or
#                  closed: the code is done and someone on dev has to measure
#                  something. Most test tasks are Main, because testers play
#                  on main. The post goes when the issue closes as fixed (any
#                  close after the comment), or when a newer "Test task:"
#                  comment does not say Server: Dev; a closed issue's newest
#                  test task then goes to #test-tasks as before, if it is
#                  Main. An issue whose last test task says Server: Dev gets
#                  no #test-tasks post from it. A dev post is for developers
#                  (Patrick, 12 Oct): the issue, its pull requests, commits,
#                  labels and build linked, and the whole test task over as
#                  many messages as it takes (dev_render). #test-tasks posts
#                  stay plain, with no number, link or code.
#
# "Server: Dev" counts only on a comment written from the day #dev-test-tasks
# began (state['dev_since'], set on the first pass that finds the forum).
# Comments from before that carried "Server: Dev" when every test task went
# to #test-tasks; they stay Main, so no post already up moves. Until the
# forum is made, every Server line is read and changes nothing, as before.
#
# Each record holds the form of the post it was made with (TASK_FORM,
# KNOWN_FORM). When the way a post is written changes, the form goes up by
# one, and every record of an older form is written again on the next pass,
# once, even though GitHub says its issue did not change.
#
# Posts carry no issue number and no link: testers have no GitHub. The bot
# remembers which post is which issue in known-issues.json in the data folder,
# written straight after each post, so a restart never posts twice; a post
# made just before a crash is found again by its title among the bot's own.

# -------------------------------------- the site's known issues and roadmap --
#
# Issue #3140 (Patrick): the site's Known Issues page and its roadmap are built
# from the board, so they cannot go stale. Until then both were boards typed
# into site/data/board.json; the roadmap's Later lane said the emote wheel was
# never started while it shipped (test-roadmap.js), and the known board kept
# NPC behaviour that #504 had fixed. The bot already reads the board for the
# Discord forums, with the one issues token there is, so it writes both lists
# into one file the site reads:
#
#   known    the posts that are up in #known-issues, the same list, each as
#            its title, its words and where it was found (Main, Dev). One
#            rule decides both: known_issues_once.
#   roadmap  every issue labelled "roadmap: now", "roadmap: next" or
#            "roadmap: later", open, in that lane; closed as done, in Done.
#            Its words are its last "Roadmap:" comment: the first line is
#            what is being built (45 characters at most), the lines under it
#            where it stands. The rules of a known issue hold for it (no
#            footer, no issue number, link or code), and so do the writing
#            rules of a public page (no em dash, never "player"). An issue
#            with a lane and no such comment, or one that breaks a rule, is
#            left off and gets one comment saying why (refuse).
#
# The file is PUBLIC_LISTS_FILE, in the site's data\from-bot folder, which
# holds only what the bot writes for the site: the site makes it, and
# Install-Bot.ps1 gives the bot's account Modify on it and nothing else of the
# site's (the other way round from for-bot, #1102). It is written whole after
# every pass, with the time of the pass, so the site can say how old it is;
# a part the bot could not read this pass is left out rather than written
# empty, and the site says that part could not be read.

# ------------------------------------------------------ the box's watchdog --
#
# Watch-Services.ps1 puts a watchdog on the VPS that restarts whatever stops
# answering, and since issue #447 it also decides what is down: one message
# when a thing dies and one when it is back, however long it stays down and
# however often it flaps. It writes them to alerts.jsonl in its folder, one
# JSON line each (id, at, service, kind, text). This says each one in the
# staff channel, by id through watch_say, which has no public fallback, and
# writes its id to alerts-sent-bot.txt, so it is said once across restarts of
# the bot too.
#
# When this bot is down, or up and not posting, the watchdog posts the message
# itself through a webhook kept on the box and writes its id to
# alerts-sent-webhook.txt. This reads that list too, so what the webhook said
# is not said again when the bot comes back.
#
# The watchdog decides and this only delivers, so there is no counting here.
# It replaced a reader of watch.log that tried to work out outages from the
# watchdog's sentences, and repeated "needs a look" every hour.
# tests\test-watch-alerts.ps1 drives the watchdog, and test-watch-services.py
# drives this against an outbox the real watchdog wrote.

# with it. That needs something off the machine (issue #448).

# and an in-game button that file an issue on the board with the log and
# where they are.
#
# In the game it is Report a problem on the help panel. The game server sends
# it to the site (kind 'problem' in inbox.json, beside the other reports),
# with where the character stands and the session the launcher has open for
# that account; watch_problems reads it there and files the issue. In Discord
# it is the panel in #test-findings, which opens a form and files the issue
# itself. Either way the issue carries PROBLEM_LABELS, so staff read it before
# it is Main or Dev Findings: those two put an issue on the public
# #known-issues, which is for real bugs only (#3137).
#
# The logs are never copied into the issue: the launcher sends them to the
# site when the game closes, and the issue links that session on the hub's
# sessions page (/sessions?find=), where staff read them with the game
# server's own lines for the same window.
#
# GITHUB_TOKEN needs issues write for this, as for github_say. A refusal is
# said once in the staff channel and the report stays in the inbox, where the
# next look files it once GitHub takes it.

# stuck logging in, hung, or cut off from Discord and never getting back is
# still that process, so the one outage the bot exists to tell staff about,
# itself, looked fine. So this writes heartbeat.json beside this file every
# HEARTBEAT_EVERY seconds: its pid, when it started, when it wrote it,
# whether it is connected to Discord, when it last was, and when it last
# handled something Discord sent it and what. The watchdog reads it
# (BeatProblem in scripts\vps\Watch-Services.ps1) and treats ten quiet
# minutes of any of those as the bot being down while its process runs.
#
# It is written from its own loop, so a hung event loop stops it, which is
# the point. Written to a temporary file and renamed over the old one, so

    A global sync can take an hour to reach everybody, and it reaches people

    being broken. Copying the commands onto the server itself and syncing that
    is immediate and the same for everyone in it.

    Registering both, which is what this did first, puts the command in the
    picker twice: Discord lists the server copy and the global copy as two
    separate entries and there is no way to tell them apart. So the guild copy
    is the one kept, and the global list is emptied straight after. Clearing
    globals is done last because copy_global_to reads that same list, and
    clearing it first would copy nothing.

    WHY IT IS BEHIND A STAMP. This was three writes to Discord per reconnect,
