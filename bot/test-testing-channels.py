test-testing-channels.py

Patrick's card of 11 October: the Live smoke checklist is gone from
#test-tasks, and the testing channels are a #test-tasks forum (one thread per
test task, tagged Dev or Main), #test-findings (what #test-results was) and a
#known-issues channel the bot keeps from GitHub issues labelled Dev Findings
or Main Findings.

This holds:

  1. The checklist is gone: no /live-smoke, no session code, no export.
  2. The one-time setup: a preview changes nothing, an apply makes the three
     changes with the old overwrites copied, the forum fallback when Discord
     will not convert a text channel, the archive locked and never deleted,
     and a second run does nothing at all. An apply that stopped half way
     finishes the rest and nothing twice.
  3. A test task is one thread, with its Dev or Main tag, never two for one
     title.
  4. Known issues: one post per open labelled issue, never a second, not
     after a restart and not after a crash between a post and its save;
     closed or unlabelled, its post is deleted; reopened, it is back.
  5. Test tasks from the board: one post per issue closed as fixed, always
     tagged Main whatever "Server:" line its "Test task:" comment carries
     (Patrick, 11 Oct: an issue closes when its fix is on main, where testers
     test), the Server line never in the body, the plain bodies saying main.
  6. Posts made with an older form (TASK_FORM, KNOWN_FORM) are written again
     once after the bot is updated, though GitHub says nothing changed, and
     after that an unchanged issue is not read again.
  7. #dev-test-tasks (Patrick, 12 Oct): the one-time setup makes it in the
     Staff category by its id, with the category's overwrites and the bot's
     #test-tasks rights, records its id, finds it again by that id after a
     rename, never makes a second, and takes one already there as it is.
  8. A "Test task:" comment with "Server: Dev", written from the day
     #dev-test-tasks began, is a post there, open issue or closed, and never
     a #test-tasks post. It goes when the issue closes after it or a newer
     test task is not Dev, and a closed issue's Main test task goes to
     #test-tasks as before. Nothing is posted twice, not after a restart and
     not after a crash between a post and its save; a post Discord refused
     is tried again. A Server: Dev line from before that day changes nothing.

The real bot module is imported. Discord and GitHub are stand-ins that
count what is asked of them. Never connects to anything.

# ------------ 11. two shapes: #dev-test-tasks for developers, #test-tasks plain --
# Patrick, 12 Oct: the dev one is for developers with GitHub, so it links the
# issue, its pull requests and commits, and gives the whole task, in developer
# terms if it was written that way; the regular test tasks stay without any
# of that, because testers are not developers and have no GitHub.
