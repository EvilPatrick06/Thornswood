"""
test-reports.py

The report watcher in bot.py: what somebody sends in on the site's public
report page is said in the staff channel the day it arrives.

The page tells a stranger "Somebody will read it", and until this the only
place it could be read was the inbox on the hub. So the things worth checking
are that a new report is said once, that a ticket is not said at all (its
thread in Discord is already where staff read it), that a flood is one line
rather than a channel nobody can read, that a file caught half written is not
taken for an empty one, and that nothing a stranger typed can ping anybody.

The real bot module is imported and the real coroutine is run over a real file
in a temp folder. Only the Discord send, the channel lookup and the sleep are
replaced.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
