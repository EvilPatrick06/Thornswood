test-uptime-ping.py

The bot pings an outside monitor every minute while it is on Discord, so a
bot or a VPS that stops is noticed from outside the box, whether or not One
is on (issue #449; Patrick, 29 Sep: "I want the bot too as well").

WHY THIS EXISTS. The heartbeat file and the watchdog both live on the VPS.
When the box itself is off, frozen or cut off, nothing on it can say so. The
outside monitor alerts when the pings stop; this checks the bot half:

  - no PING_URL means no ping, said once in bot.log, and the loop ends
  - a monitor that answers gets one GET, and the first success is said once
  - a monitor that is down, refuses, or answers 500 is said once per outage,
    and once when it answers again
  - a slow monitor is cut off by the timeout, and never holds up the event
    loop that handles Discord, and a ping in flight is never doubled
  - nothing is sent while the bot is not on Discord
  - the address never appears in anything the bot logs
  - setup_hook starts the loop, and the setting's name is the one
    Install-Bot.ps1 -SetPing writes

The real bot module is imported and its real functions are run against a fake
monitor on 127.0.0.1. Never connects to anything else.
