  Build-Onboarding.py

  Sets Discord's onboarding (Server Settings, Onboarding) from the rows it was
  written out in, issue #427: the default channels (board.json r25n), the hold
  question (r26n, r27n) and the "what are you here for" question (r28n).

  Everything is looked up by NAME on the server when it runs, so the roles and
  channels it hands out are the real ones on the day, not ids copied into a
  file that goes stale. It talks to Discord's REST API directly
  (GET and PUT /guilds/{id}/onboarding), so it needs no discord.py.

      python bot\\Build-Onboarding.py --check          reads, prints, changes nothing
      python bot\\Build-Onboarding.py --off            writes it, leaves it switched off
      python bot\\Build-Onboarding.py                  writes it and switches it on

  scripts\\deploy\\Set-DiscordOnboarding.ps1 asks for the token without showing
  it and runs this. Run --check first, every time.

  THE APPLICATION GATE. Since 23 and 24 September somebody who joins sees
  #welcome, #rules, #start-here, #say-hello and the Applications category, and
  nothing else until staff give them Member (Build-Discord.py, THE GATE). The
  game itself opens on a separate role given when an application is accepted
  (site\\server.js access.play, Playtester). So by default this hands out no
  role at all: the hold question, which gives Member and a Citizen role, is
  left out, because holds are picked in #choose-your-hold once somebody is in
  (bot.py). --grant-member puts the hold question back exactly as r26n and r27n
  wrote it, and with it everybody who answers gets Member. It never hands out
  a role that opens the game or carries any power: see ALLOWED_ROLES.

  RULES AND AGE, OFF UNLESS ASKED. Entry 181 asked whether accepting the rules
  and stating the age go into onboarding too, so it is switched on once.
  --rules and --age each add one required question with a single answer, and
  both are off by default until Patrick and Djinn decide.

  WHAT DISCORD REFUSES. With onboarding on, Discord wants at least 7 default
  channels and at least 5 of them that @everyone can post in. Channels only
  some roles can see cannot be default channels or answers. The check works all
  of that out from the server as it is, says exactly which channel fails and
  why, and sends nothing while anything fails.

  The token is read from DISCORD_TOKEN and never printed. The bot needs Manage
  Server and Manage Roles for the PUT (Discord's rule for this endpoint). It
  keeps Administrator (#3317, Patrick, 22 Oct 2026), which covers both.

  --off           write the questions and channels but leave onboarding off,

  --grant-member  add the hold question, which gives Member and a Citizen role
                  to everybody who answers (off: the application gate stays)
  --rules         add a required "have you read the rules" question (off)
  --age           add a required "are you 18 or over" question (off)
  --guild <id>    which server, when the bot is in more than one
