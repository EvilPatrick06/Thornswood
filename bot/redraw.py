redraw.py

One-off: the join cards that went up before card.py learned to draw dressed-up
names came out as a row of boxes. This finds every card of the bot's in the
welcome channels whose person has a name the old card could not draw, draws
it again with the current card.py, and swaps the picture on the existing
message. No new messages, no new pings.

    python redraw.py          list the cards it would redraw, change nothing
    python redraw.py --go     redraw them
    python redraw.py --all    every card, not only the ones that had boxes

Reads the same bot.env.json as the bot (run.ps1 puts it in the environment).
The number on the card is the one joins.json holds for that person, read
through bot.py's own functions, so a redrawn card says what the bot gave
them. Somebody the record has no number for, because their card went up
before the bot kept one, gets the old rule, their place in the join order
among the members still here, and the line for them says so. A record that is
there and cannot be read stops the run: redrawing with guesses is how two
cards came to say "The 28th to walk in".

It reads joins.json and never writes it. Redrawing swaps a picture on a card
that is already up; it gives nobody a number, so it has nothing to record.
The record is the one beside this file, so run it in the bot's folder on the
VPS; anywhere else there is none and every number is the old rule.
