test-3155-problems.py

Report a problem (#3155): the bot's half. Patrick, 21 Oct: testers get a
Discord button and an in-game button that file an issue on the board with
their log and where they are.

The game's problems come in through the site's inbox.json, kind 'problem';
problems_once files each one on the board once, oldest first, and says it in
the staff channel with its number. The Discord panel in #test-findings opens
a form and files the issue itself. Checked here: the issue each makes (its
title, the words exactly as typed and unable to ping or format anything, the
session link, the labels that keep it off the public #known-issues), filing
once and never twice across a stop, what a GitHub refusal does, who may use
the panel and how often, and that the panel is wired in.

The real bot module is imported. GitHub, the staff channel and the saved
record are stand-ins. Read only. Never connects to anything.
