What the live build of 22 Oct left (#3317, the Cloud Desk's run, comment
6348042833 on the issue):

  G1 the staff pulled into every ticket are one list, by name, in bot.py's
     STAFF_ROLES default, Install-Bot's -StaffRoles default and
     Build-Discord.py's TICKET_STAFF, and it holds the whole council. The
     run found Install-Bot's default without the council, so every full
     Install-Bot dropped the council from tickets
  G2 -Give finds one member exactly, by id or by a whole name, never by a
     part of one
  G3 -Give refuses a second rank of one category, a rank to a seat holder
     and anything that is not a staff rank, and says when a rank is held
  G4 -Give gives through Discord, and under -Check gives nothing
  G5 a name that matches nobody, or more than one, gives nothing and says
     the names like it
  G6 a whole build switches Discord's Onboarding off before it gates a
     channel (Patrick picked the Member button, q-3317-member-gate A, and
     Onboarding made Discord refuse the gate on two channels); -Check and a
     server with it off ask nothing
  G7 the audit says Onboarding is on, and prints every plan role's id and
     the two Install-Bot lines bot.env.json is written with

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name, so its __main__
block never runs. Never connects to anything.
