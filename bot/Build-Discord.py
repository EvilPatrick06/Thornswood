  Build-Discord.py

  Builds the whole Thornswood Discord in one run: roles, categories, channels,
  permissions, and the words in the read only channels.

  Safe to run more than once. Anything already there by name is left alone,
  anything missing is made, and the read only posts are rewritten from
  content.py. So changing the rules is an edit and a re run, not forty clicks.

      pip install -U discord.py
      python Build-Discord.py

  It never deletes anything unless DISCORD_PRUNE=1 is set, and even then only
  inside the categories it made and only names it knows it no longer wants.
  The names in KEEP are never deleted, whatever any other list in here says.

  It wants a bot token. Put it in the environment rather than on the command
  line, so it does not sit in your shell history:

      $env:DISCORD_TOKEN = 'paste-it-here'
      python Build-Discord.py

  Or run Setup-Discord.ps1, which asks for it without showing it.

  Before any of that:

    1. https://discord.com/developers/applications, the same application the
       website login uses is fine, or a new one.
    2. Bot in the sidebar. Add a bot, then Reset Token and copy it.
    3. Under Bot, turn ON "Server Members Intent". Leave the other two OFF.
    4. OAuth2 then URL Generator: tick "bot", then "Administrator", open the
       URL it makes and add it to the Thornswood server. The bot keeps
       Administrator, for a build and the rest of the time (#3317, Patrick,
       22 Oct 2026: "the bot will keep admin"). A build makes the Owner and
       Co-Owner roles, which carry Administrator, and Discord refuses that
       from a bot without it.
    5. Server Settings, Enable Community. Without it there are no forum
       channels, no announcement channels and no rules screen, and this falls
       back to plain text channels for those. That screen asks for a
       Community Updates and a Safety Notifications channel: take what it
       offers, and the next run of this moves both to #staff-updates.

  The bot needs to be ABOVE the roles it creates, so drag its own role to the
  top of the role list once it has joined.

  ADMINISTRATOR STAYS ON. It used to come off after every build and go back
  on before the next; Patrick ended that on 22 Oct 2026 (#3317). RUN_BITS
  below is still what bot.py itself uses, and the audit says when the bot is
  without Administrator or one of those. To see the invite link without
  building anything, and without a token:

      python Build-Discord.py --invite <application id>

  The application id is on the developer portal's General Information page.

# name, so the integer can be checked against the page by hand. It is read
# off what bot.py calls:
#
#   Manage Channels           log_channel makes the staff only #tickets when
#                             there is none
#   View Channel              every channel it reads or posts in

#   Attach Files              the join card is a picture
#   Read Message History      finds its own panels to edit in place
#   Manage Roles              the hold and ping buttons give and take roles,
#                             and the two ping roles are made when missing
#   Manage Threads            a ticket thread is private and not invitable, so
#                             only a moderator can add people to it, Close
#                             locks it, and a ticket is deleted 365 days

#   Create Public Threads     threads the bot opens (the Live smoke session
#                             thread until 11 Oct; forum posts need only Send)
#   Create Private Threads    one per ticket
#   Send Messages in Threads  writes the ticket into its thread
#
# Left out on purpose: Administrator, Manage Server, Manage Webhooks, Manage
# Messages, Pin Messages and Embed Links, which only the build uses or
# nothing uses. Interaction replies and direct messages need no permission.

# is accepted, opens everything else that is not staff. Staff see their own
# space and Staff, and the council sees every space. Until #3317 the gate was
# Member, set by hand on 23 and 24 September, and Playtester opened only
# Testing.
#
# THE BUILD SETS EVERY PLANNED CHANNEL'S OVERWRITES TO ITS MODE (#3317). Until
# #3317 a mode reached only a channel the build made, so the live server
# drifted from the plan wherever a channel was gated by hand, and nothing said
# so. Now every category and channel named here gets exactly the overwrites its
# mode gives, on every run; an overwrite for one member that is not the bot is
# kept as it is. -Check says which would change, and -Audit says how.
#
# key is what the words in content.py point at, so a channel can be renamed
# without every mention of it going stale.
#
# post is the words the build writes in a read only channel, and makes that
# channel a doc: it keeps a changelog (DOCS in content.py, check_docs below).
#
# was lists (category, name) pairs the channel used to be. A channel missing
# from its place is looked for there first and renamed or moved, never made a
# second time, so its id, history, pins and posts go with it (#3317: the bot
# finds #dev-test-tasks by id, and the Testing forums by name).
#
# make=False means the channel is in the plan and is never created: the plan
# is what prune keeps, so this is how a channel that has been deleted on
# purpose stays deleted without becoming something prune would delete the
# next one of its name.
#
# THE CATEGORY A CHANNEL IS IN IS PART OF ITS NAME HERE. A channel is matched
# by name inside the category this names, so a channel dragged into another
# category by hand looks missing and the next run brings it back by its was
# line, or makes a second one when it has none. That is how the live server
# ended up with two #game-rules once.

#
# To Do List 223, "The bot is invited with Administrator and keeps it", and
# since #3317 it does for good (Patrick, 22 Oct 2026). These overwrites stay so
# that a server whose bot role loses it still works, and the audit says so.
# Administrator overrides every channel overwrite, and that is the only
# reason the bot can see the staff channels, the channels behind Member and
# the holds, and post in the read only ones: nothing below ever named it.
# Without Administrator the @everyone deny lands on the bot too, since
# nothing here gives it Member, a staff role or a hold. The trouble alerts
# and the watchdog's messages, both in #staff-updates (bot.py, TROUBLE_ID,
# WATCH_ID and staff-channel.txt), go quiet, the hold panel cannot be posted
# in #choose-your-hold, and -Posts can no longer write the rules, welcome,
# news and faq posts.
#
# So the bot gets an overwrite for itself as a member, the way bot.py's
# log_channel already makes #ticket-log. Discord applies a member's own
# overwrite last, after @everyone and every role, so it wins over the deny.
# Three permissions and no more: see the channel, post in it, and read
# back what is there, which is how post() finds its old messages to delete.
# The build itself still wants Administrator, because it makes the Owner and
# Dev roles with Administrator on them and Discord refuses that from a bot
# which does not hold it.

# a private thread there and then not write the ticket into it. A thread takes
