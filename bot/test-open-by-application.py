test-open-by-application.py

The Discord side of #428: "There is no public mode: the panel, the read-only
posts, the access list and the age question all describe the closed
playtest, and nobody ever accepts the rules."

Patrick, 28 Sep: "we are in alpha so the world is open by application".
Anyone can download it, getting in is an application in the Discord, the
Playtester role that comes with being accepted unlocks Play, and it is an
alpha. So this checks:

  1. The panel and its first kind say that, and nothing says closed playtest.
  2. The application asks the age question (18 and over stays) and a rules
     question, inside Discord's five question limit and its label lengths.
  3. A yes to the rules goes to the site with the ticket, where it is kept
     against the Discord id; anything else is flagged at the top of the
     thread for staff, and never stops the application.
  4. The read only posts (#welcome, #rules, #faq, #start-here) say the same,
     read from the real content.py.
  5. The one switch the issue asked for, the site's "open", built and left
     off: the bot reads it off /api/public (THORNSWOOD_OPEN overrides), and
     on, the application and its two questions leave the panel and the posts
     say anyone in the Discord can play. Off puts it all back.

The real bot module is imported and the real TicketModal.on_submit is run.
Only what touches the world is replaced: the guild, the thread, the
interaction, the push to the site and the file of open tickets, which goes in
a temporary folder. Never connects to anything.
