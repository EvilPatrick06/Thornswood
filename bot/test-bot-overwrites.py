"""
test-bot-overwrites.py

The bot keeps its channels without Administrator.

From the To Do List, entry 223: "The bot is invited with Administrator and
keeps it." Administrator overrides every channel overwrite, and nothing in
Build-Discord.py ever named the bot, so the only reason it could see the staff
channels, the channels behind Member and the holds, and post in the read only
ones was Administrator. Untick it and the @everyone deny shuts the bot out
along with everybody else: the trouble alerts and the watchdog's messages
in #staff-updates go quiet, and so does the hold panel.

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name so its __main__
block never runs. Its client is swapped for a stand-in, and every guild, role
and channel here is a stand-in that records what would have been asked of
Discord. The live server is modelled as it is today: every role, category and
channel already there behind the gate set by hand on 23 and 24 September,
which is what the builder's modes now describe, with nothing naming the bot.
Plus two channels made by hand: a staff #news in the Staff category, and one
left open to everybody inside a category that is behind the gate.

The bot's permissions in a channel are worked out in Discord's documented
order: @everyone's and the member's roles, then Administrator, then the
@everyone overwrite, then the roles' overwrites together, then the member's
own overwrite last.

Read only. Never connects to anything and never writes beside the code: the
news webhook the builder saves is pointed at a temporary folder.
