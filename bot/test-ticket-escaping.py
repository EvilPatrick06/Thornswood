"""
test-ticket-escaping.py

Nothing somebody types into an application can ping anybody, and nothing in it
is read as formatting.

Issue #1354. The answers on a ticket form are typed by whoever is applying,
and until this they went into the private thread exactly as typed. An answer
of "@everyone" pinged the server from inside a staff thread, a role mention
pulled a role in, and a line of asterisks hid the rest of the application
behind a heading. The same words went into the staff only channel when the
thread would not open.

Three things stop it now, and this checks all of them: the words are escaped on
the way into Discord (as_typed), every post that carries them is sent with
mentions switched off, so a mention the escaping does not know about still
pings nobody, and every ticket post suppresses embeds, so a bare link in an
answer cannot draw its preview.
The site copy is checked as well, because it keeps the answers as typed and
the page escapes its own output.

The real bot module is imported and the real TicketModal.on_submit is run. Only
what touches the world is replaced: the guild, its channels, threads and roles,
the interaction, the push to the site, and the file of open tickets, which is
pointed at a temporary folder so this cannot touch the one beside the code.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
