test-join-card.py

The join card counts arrivals properly, and it is drawn on the Thornswood
banner.

Patrick, 24 September, with a screenshot of #welcome-travelers and a tester's
note "make it a Thornswood banner": "#28 twice plus the banner backgound needs
changed to the thornswood". Daggerio came up the road at 19:41 and VENUS at
22:45, and both cards said "The 28th to walk in", because the number was the
server's member count at that moment and somebody had left in between.

The real bot module is imported and the real on_member_join is run, with a
stand-in server whose member count is set by hand, a stand-in welcome channel
that keeps what is sent to it, and card.render swapped for something that
writes down the number it was asked to draw. The record is pointed at a
temporary folder so this cannot touch one beside the code.

The background half runs the real card.render and the real make-join-card.py.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
