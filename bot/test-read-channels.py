"""
test-read-channels.py

#start-here, #welcome and #faq say what the join page says, because they are
read out of it, and every message the builder would send fits in Discord.

From the To Do List, entry 185: "The start channel promises two files, twenty
gigabytes copied into place, and that the Skyrim you already play will not be
touched; the person then meets Vortex, a collection and a downgrade." And the
way it asked for it to be fixed: "Generate them from join.md and help.md so
they cannot drift."

So this checks three things.

  1. The words. The dead promises are gone and Vortex, Nexus and the
     collection are there, in the real content.py read against the real
     site/data/site/join.md.
  2. That they cannot drift. Every paragraph of join.md is in #start-here,
     and a copy of content.py pointed at an edited join.md follows the edit,
     or refuses to load when the paragraph it quotes has gone.
  3. That they fit. Build-Discord.py's own post() is run on every read only
     post with a stand in channel that keeps what it is sent, and every
     message has to be under Discord's 2000 characters with nothing lost.

Build-Discord.py is loaded as a module, which defines things and connects to
nothing: client.run is only reached when it is run as a script, and no token
is involved. Nothing here posts anywhere.

Read only, apart from a temporary folder it removes.
