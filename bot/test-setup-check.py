# Issue #1211. Setup-Discord -Check must not say the AFK channel or the join
# message was set when nothing changed. This runs Build-Discord's own
# apply_welcome_and_afk in check mode against a stand-in guild. Nothing here
# logs in, and no token is set.
#
# When the stand-in is already the way the build wants, the output has no set
# line for the AFK channel or the join message. When a change would happen,
# the line says would change, and still not set.
