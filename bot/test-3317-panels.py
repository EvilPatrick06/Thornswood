test-3317-panels.py

The bot's button panels sit in even rows that fit a phone (#3317).

Patrick, 22 Oct 2026, with a phone screenshot of #choose-your-hold: "These
button layouts also need fixed". The hold panel put five holds in a row, and a
phone wrapped that row as four and then Markarth on its own, and the next as
three and then Winterhold on its own. This proves:

  L1 the hold panel is three rows of three holds, in HOLDS order, with the two
     ping buttons in a row of their own under them
  L2 no row of any persistent panel has more than three buttons
  L3 a posted panel laid out the old way (five, four, two) is not taken for
     current, so the bot's start rewrites it; one laid out as wanted is current
  L4 the office panel is one row per office, Add beside Remove

bot.py is imported for real. Read only. Never connects to anything.
