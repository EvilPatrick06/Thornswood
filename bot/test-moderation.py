"""
test-moderation.py

The staff action watcher in bot.py (#412): what a moderator does in the game
(/kick, /freeze, /silence, /warn and the rest) is said in the staff channel,
once, from for-bot\\moderation.log beside each game server (#2321).

Checked: what is already in the files when the bot starts is treated as said;
a new line is said once and says which server; a line still being written is
left for the next look; a line that is not an action says nothing; a flood is
one line; a file that cannot be read is skipped rather than read as empty,
and said in bot.log once, and again once it can be read (#2321); nothing
typed in the game can ping anybody.

The real bot module is imported and the real coroutine is run over real
files in a temp folder. Only the Discord send, the client and the sleep are
replaced. Read only. Never connects to anything.
