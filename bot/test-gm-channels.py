The Gamemasters category is the gamemasters' space.

Djinn's layout of 15 Oct 2026, confirmed by him on 17 Oct (#2519): the
gamemaster ranks and Moderator, @everyone denied, nothing public. Since #3317
(Patrick, 22 Oct) it is one of the staff spaces, the same shape as the others:
the council (Owner, Co-Owner and every lead) sees every space, an
announcements channel the gamemasters read and the council posts in, and
#gm-rules read only but for Lead Gamemaster, Owner and Co-Owner. Loremasters
read #gm-announcements, #gm-event-plans and #gm-scene-summaries, so a scene
stays inside the lore.

Holds:

  G1 Build-Discord.py has a Gamemasters category with #gm-announcements,
     #gm-rules, #gm-event-plans, #gm-scene-summaries, #gm-chat,
     #gm-suggestions, #gm-discipline and GM Voice, in that order, and the old
     #gm only as make=False; Djinn's channels are all in KEEP
  G2 every channel in it is a Gamemasters space mode, nothing public, open,
     read or membersread sits in it, and no other category uses that space
  G3 the category itself is gated as the Gamemasters space
  G4 @everyone cannot see a channel of the space
  G5 the space lets the gamemaster ranks, Moderator and the council see,
     talk and read back
  G6 it grants nothing to Member, Playtester, Dev or the other ranks
  G7 the only other entry is the bot itself, so it keeps the channels
     without Administrator
  G8 a gamemaster role that is not on the server is passed over rather than
     stopping the build
  G9 #gm-rules: the ranks read and cannot post, start threads or post in
     them; Lead Gamemaster, Owner and Co-Owner post; the rest get nothing
  G10 Loremasters read the three channels named for them and talk in none

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name, so its __main__
block never runs. Read only. Never connects to anything.
