"""
test-ticket-fallback.py

When a private thread will not open, the ticket goes to a channel only staff
can read, and never into a channel everybody can.

From the To Do List, entry 154: "When a private thread cannot open, reports
and applications are posted into the public channel", and "A reported member
reading the report in the channel is a safety problem, not a formatting one."

The fallback used to post the whole ticket into the channel the panel lives
in, which the whole server can read. The obvious fix, posting it into the log
channel instead, was broken too: TICKET_LOG's first name is tickets, and until
24 September Build-Discord.py's PLAN made a #tickets with mode='open'. The PLAN
now makes #tickets staff only, but it never changes a channel that is already
there, so the log channel is checked by its permissions, not trusted by its
name.

The real bot module is imported and the real coroutines are run: on_submit,
log_channel and ensure_panel. Only what touches Discord is replaced, by stub
guilds, channels, roles and people, and the thread creation always raises.
The site push is replaced by a counter. One scenario loads Build-Discord.py
too, without running it, to build #tickets from the PLAN's own roles and
overwrites. The one open ticket file is pointed at a scratch folder, so the
real one beside bot.py is never read or written.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
