A category per hold, Raven Rock included (#3317).

Patrick, 22 Oct 2026: "The Holds also need a guards and court channel for the
Guards and cour members. Each hold needs an announcement chanel for the Hold
that Jarls of that Hold and the court can post to for needed IC info". On the
page he picked a category per hold (q-3317-hold-layout, A), the court with the
Steward and the guards apart (q-3317-hold-office-access, A), and Raven Rock the
same as the nine (q-3317-raven-rock, A). This proves:

  H1 every hold, Raven Rock last, is a category of its own with its
     announcements, its hall, its court and its guard channel, in that order
  H2 the hall is today's hold channel, moved out of The Holds by name, and
     The Holds is retired; #choose-your-hold moved to In Character
  H3 the hall: its Citizen, Jarl and officers talk; another hold's citizen
     gets nothing
  H4 the announcements: its citizens and guards read and cannot post; the
     Jarl, Steward and Court post
  H5 the court: the Jarl, Steward and Court; not the guards, not citizens
  H6 the guard: the Jarl and the guards; not the court, not citizens
  H7 HOLD_STAFF (the council, gamemasters, loremasters, moderators, devs)
     talks in the hall, court and guard and reads the announcements, which
     the council posts in like every other; @everyone sees none
  H8 each hold's category is gated to that hold

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name, so its __main__
block never runs. Read only. Never connects to anything.
