test-heartbeat.py

The bot writes a heartbeat the watchdog can read, so a bot that is running
but not on Discord is a bot that is down (issue #449).

WHY THIS EXISTS. The watchdog on the VPS knew one thing about the bot: that a
python process with Thornswood-Bot in its command line was alive. A bot stuck
logging in, hung, or cut off from Discord for good is still that process, so
the one outage the bot is there to tell staff about, itself, looked fine. Now
the bot writes heartbeat.json beside itself every minute, and BeatProblem in
scripts\\vps\\Watch-Services.ps1 reads it. This checks the bot half: what the
file says before it connects, while it is connected, after it drops and when
it comes back, that it is written whole or not at all, that a folder it
cannot write to never stops the bot, that it is written from its own loop
started once per process, and that every field the watchdog reads is one the
bot writes. tests\\test-bot-heartbeat.ps1 checks the watchdog half.

The real bot module is imported and its real functions and event handlers are
run. The heartbeat file is pointed at a temporary folder, so this cannot touch
the one beside the code.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
