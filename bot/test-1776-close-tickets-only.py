test-1776-close-tickets-only.py

/close and the Close ticket button close a ticket and nothing else (#1776).

close_here only asked whether it was used in a thread. Staff running /close
in a Live smoke session thread, a #tales post or any other thread archived
and locked it, and the bot wrote "Closed: <thread name>" with a link in the
staff ticket record as if it were a ticket. A ticket is a thread off a
channel named in TICKET_CHANNEL, the only place TicketModal opens one; a
ticket that could not have its thread goes into the TICKET_LOG channel as a
plain message, never a thread.

This runs the real /close command, the real Close ticket button and
close_here, as staff, in threads that are not tickets, and expects the
"only works inside a ticket" line to them alone, and nothing archived,
locked, said in the thread or written down. Then the same as staff in a
ticket under every TICKET_CHANNEL name, which still closes, archives, locks
and writes it down, so a gate that refuses everything does not pass.

The real bot module is imported. Only what touches Discord is replaced: the
interaction, the threads and their channels, and the staff channel the
record goes to.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
