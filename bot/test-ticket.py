"""
test-ticket.py

Somebody who presses Submit on a ticket hears back as soon as the ticket
exists in Discord, and the copy for the site goes after it without anybody
waiting on it.

From the To Do List, entry 253: "Acknowledge as soon as the thing they asked
for exists and do the bookkeeping afterwards. A spinner that sits for ten
seconds reads as broken to somebody who has never used the server, and the
site copy still lands."

The push to the site is urlopen with a twelve second timeout. It was awaited
before the reply, so with the site down a stranger pressing Submit watched the
bot think for twelve seconds before being told their ticket was open.

The real bot module is imported and the real TicketModal.on_submit is run.
Discord is replaced by small fakes that write down what happened and in what
order, and the push to the site is held open until the test lets it go. So the
order is measured rather than timed: on the code before the fix, the reply
cannot come until the held push gives up, and every order check below fails.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
