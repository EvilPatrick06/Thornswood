test-game-rules.py

The rules for playing have one copy, the /rules page, and #game-rules is read
out of it.

From issue #430, "The rules disagree with themselves on the one rule people
get banned over": #game-rules and lore\\game-rules.md said a fight with
another character is asked for out of character first, and
site\\data\\site\\rules.md said "Fights start freely". Two people in the same
fight could each be following the posted rules. Patrick decided on 28 Sep
that fights start freely and that the site page is the one source.

So this checks four things.

  1. One source. content.GAME_RULES carries every paragraph of the page's
     "In the World" part word for word, RULES (the Discord conduct rules) is
     still there beside it, and a copy of content.py pointed at an edited
     rules.md follows the edit, or refuses to load when the part has gone.
  2. No old wording. The site's sentence is in exactly one file, the page,
     and the "ask first" sentences are in none, across bot, site, lore,
     launcher and docs (docs\\archive is the record of how it was, and is
     left alone).
  3. The lore copy is a pointer to /rules and carries no rules of its own.
  4. The enforcement section names what exists: a Discord timeout and a
     removal, not a Moderator and then a Gamemaster in the world.

Read only, apart from a temporary folder it removes.
