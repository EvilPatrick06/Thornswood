"""
test-3317-audit.py

Build-Discord.py --audit reads the live server, says where it differs from
the plan, and changes nothing (#3317).

Patrick, 22 Oct 2026: every role's permissions right globally, per category,
per channel and for the bot, and nobody holding two ranks of one staff
category. The plan only says what a channel the builder MAKES gets, and the
live server was gated by hand, so the audit is the read that says what is
really there.

Build-Discord.py is imported for real, under another name so its __main__
block never runs. The guild is a stand-in that matches the plan exactly, and
then is put wrong one way at a time; every write a stand-in could be asked
for is recorded, and none may happen.

Read only. Never connects to anything.
