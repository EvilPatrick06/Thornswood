<#
  Go.ps1 - installs the front, the overlays and the plugins, then reports what
  the server is doing.

  What changed and why, so none of this looks arbitrary later:

  1. There is one browser and three things wanted it. The emote wheel called
     loadUrl on a page of its own, which replaced the chat and the names above
     heads. Last caller wins, and the wheel always called last. So one plugin,
     thornswood-front.js, loads one page, and the wheel and voice mount into it
     as overlays. Nothing else calls loadUrl.

  2. SkyrimPlatform's default page address is the bare string
     file:///Data/Platform/UI/index.html, which CEF reads from the filesystem
     root: C:\Data\Platform\UI, which exists on nobody's machine. The front has
     therefore never once loaded. It is loaded by absolute path now.

  3. Plugins share one global scope. A top level `function log()` becomes a
     property of that shared object, so the last plugin loaded silently replaced
     every other plugin's log: chargen's lines were being written into the
     probe's file under the probe's prefix. Every plugin is wrapped now.

  4. Voice runs in the launcher now, in a hidden WebView2 window
     (launcher\app\Voice.cs and launcher\voice-host.html, which
     launcher\app\ARCHITECTURE.md walks through). It first ran inside the
     game, because the game's browser, served from http on a remote address,
     never exposed a microphone, and it moved out for the same reason.

  THE LAUNCHER'S KEPT COPIES FOLLOW WHAT THIS PUTS IN.

  The launcher keeps a copy of every file of ours under Data\Platform, in
  Profile\Keep beside the game folder, and puts it back at every Play over
  whatever else is there (Keep.cs), which is how a tester's install survives
  another server's launcher writing over ours. A pack refreshes that copy when
  it writes the file (Updater.cs, Keep.Remember). What this script installs
  never comes in a pack on the machine that runs it, so without the same step
  the next Play put the previous copy back over what was just installed.

  Until 25 September Profile\developer.flag did that job on the machine that
  ships, by letting any game file newer than its kept copy win. It also meant
  that machine never saw the repair a tester's launcher makes, which is why it
  went (Patrick: "it will make testing easier"). So every file this run puts
  under Data\Platform becomes the kept copy, and every file it takes out loses
  its kept copy, the way a pack does. Nothing else in the game folder is
  adopted: a file another launcher wrote is still put back at Play.

  # that has the same answer a customer would get.

  # The game server IS asked on its raw port above, and that is right: 3000
  # binds every interface because the game client connects to it directly.

  <#
    The voice service carries text chat now as well as audio, so it has to be
    the current copy. Two things were wrong with how this did that.

    It read voice-server.js from the tools folder. The real one moved into
    voice months ago and the copy left behind at the top went stale, so
    running this pushed an old build over a good one.

    And the restart below had three literal vertical tab bytes in it, where a
    backslash-v had been eaten by whatever wrote the file: the path it handed
    node was C:\Thornswood-Voice<VT>oice-server.js, which cannot exist. Since
    it killed the running service first, this did not fail to restart voice.
    It stopped voice and left it stopped.

    It now restarts the scheduled task rather than launching node loose. A
    loose node and the task's own restart timer both want port 7778, and the
    loser dies quietly while the winner keeps serving whatever it was already
    running, which is the exact failure that hid days of changes.
