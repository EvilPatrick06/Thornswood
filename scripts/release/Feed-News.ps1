  Feed-News.ps1

  The notes the launcher's News tab shows, wherever the feed keeps them (#1050).

      . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'Feed-News.ps1')

  WHY IT EXISTS. Measured 12 Oct over https, the news was 31,282 of main's
  95,085 bytes of version.json and 19,980 of dev's 111,305: once the packs and
  the releases list came off the feed, most of what is left, and every
  launcher reads the whole feed on every check, every thirty seconds while the
  game runs. Every launcher up to 1.2.3 reads the News tab only out of "news"
  in version.json. From the first launcher with launcher\app\FeedNews.cs it
  also reads "newsFile": { url, sha256, count }, one asset at
  /feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256> holding the same list, and shows its notes after
  the ones "news" carries.

  So a channel keeps its notes in "news" until the launcher it lets into the
  game (minLauncher, which a publish sets to the launcher it offers) reads the
  file, and from then they are one asset named as "newsFile" and "news" is []:

      Test-FeedNewsOut <minLauncher>       true from $FeedNewsFileLauncher on
      Get-FeedNewsList $doc                every note, newest first: "news",
                                           then the file's that "news" does not
                                           carry, by date and title
      Open-FeedNewsList $doc               the same, put whole into "news" in
                                           memory with "newsFile" taken out,
                                           for a script about to change them
      Set-FeedNewsList $doc $news ...      puts the list back the way the
                                           channel keeps it, sending the file
                                           to the site first when it is one

  Every script that adds a note, marks one or reads them goes through these:
  Publish-Update, Rollback-Feed, Publish-Server's news entry, Dev-News's DEV
  marks, Publish-News and Publish-Discord. A feed written by a publisher from
  before this carries its newest note in "news" beside an older file, and the
  list is the two together, so no note is lost.

  $FeedNewsFileLauncher is the first launcher number with FeedNews.cs: 1.2.4,
  the number after 1.2.3, which went out on both channels on 11 Oct without
  it. That holds as long as FeedNews.cs is on main before Bump-Version.ps1
  moves main to 1.2.4, which it was (#1050). Every dev number climbs from
  main's, so dev's first such launcher is 1.2.4 or a 1.2.4.N.
