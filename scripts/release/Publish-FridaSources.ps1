  Publish-FridaSources.ps1

  The source of what is inside frida-gum.lib, on one permanent Release of this
  repository (#3287, Patrick's answer C of 26 Oct 2026).

      pwsh scripts/release/Publish-FridaSources.ps1              make the Release
      pwsh scripts/release/Publish-FridaSources.ps1 -Check       is the source the notes name reachable
      pwsh scripts/release/Publish-FridaSources.ps1 -ForksMayGo  may the six forks be deleted yet

  WHY. SkyrimPlatformImpl.dll links frida-gum.lib, Frida's own build, and that
  lib also holds glib, gobject and proxy-libintl, which are the LGPL with no
  exception for binaries. The dll goes out under the GPL, so their source has
  to stay reachable, with directions to it beside the file (THIRD-PARTY.md,
  the frida-gum paragraph). Until now the directions were six forks of
  Frida's repositories. Patrick's answer C: each part goes up as an archive of
  its commit on one Release of this repository, which stays as long as the
  launcher ships frida-gum, and the forks are deleted once nothing offered
  still names only them. records\frida-sources.json names the parts, their
  commits and each archive's sha256 and bytes.

  MAKE (no switch). Run by .github/workflows/frida-sources.yml with the run's
  own token in GH_TOKEN. For each part: fetches the fork's tag (the
  record's forkTag), checks it is the recorded commit, makes the archive with
  git archive --format=tar --prefix=<name>-<commit>/ (plain tar, because a
  compressed one is not the same bytes from one git to the next: measured 27
  Oct, git 2.43's own gzip and gzip -cn differ), and checks its sha256 and
  bytes against the record. Then a draft Release on the record's tag, every
  archive uploaded, each held to GitHub's own digest, and only then
  published, never as the latest (the newest game release stays that). Run
  again on a published, whole Release, it says so and changes nothing. It
  works the same in a private repository: these are other people's public
  sources, and the Release is ready when the repository is public.

  WHAT IT REFUSES. A fork whose tag is not the recorded commit, an archive
  that is not the recorded bytes, and a published Release that lacks an
  archive or holds one that is not the recorded bytes: a published Release is
  never changed. Each says which and exits 1, with nothing published.

  -CHECK. The nightly run (nightly.yml). What the notes beside the files name
  has to answer:
    - the Release, once it is made: published, every archive on it with
      GitHub's digest the recorded sha256 and the recorded bytes. Once the
      repository is public it has to be made: a note since version 3 of
      Source-Notice.ps1 names it first;
    - while the record says forksUp: each fork's tag, at the recorded commit.
  And the record has to be of the Frida that client-licences.json says the
  client files carry: a new Frida is a new set of archives on a new Release.
  Exit 0 all of that holds, 1 something does not, each one said.

  -FORKSMAYGO. Whether the forks may go: the Release is published and whole,
  the repository is public, and nothing offered names only the forks. A note
  names the Release from Source-Notice.ps1's version 3, so: each live feed's
  client runtime carries notice 3 or later, the release each live feed names
  was made from a commit whose Source-Notice.ps1 is version 3 or later (the
  packs, the baseline and on main the installer are made by that release's
  Ship), and so was every Release of this repository's game release tags.
  Exit 0 they may go (then the record's forksUp goes false in the same pull
  request that says so), 2 not yet, each reason said, 1 it could not be read.

  Every call out goes through Invoke-GitHub, Invoke-Git and Get-SiteText, so
  tests\test-3287-frida-sources.ps1 can stand in for GitHub, the forks and
  the site.
