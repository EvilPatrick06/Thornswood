.SYNOPSIS
  Sends a published file to VirusTotal so the report the site links to exists,
  or says plainly that it is not sending and carries on.

.DESCRIPTION
  The Downloads page prints the installer's SHA-256 with a link to VirusTotal's
  report on that hash, so somebody who wants to know what they are about to run
  can read a report rather than upload 700 MB themselves (entry 176 on the To Do
  List). Publish-Installer.ps1 has written that hash and printed that address
  since 24 September, and nothing ever sent the file, so the link has always
  landed on VirusTotal's "item not found" page. This is the missing half.

  NOTHING HERE CAN STOP A RELEASE. Every way out of this script is exit 0 with
  one line saying what happened: no key, no file, a key VirusTotal refuses, a
  file too big for it, a network that is not there. A release that is already
  published and on the site is not undone by a report that is missing, and
  Ship and Publish-Installer carry on either way. The line is the record.

  THE KEY IS READ FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AND FROM NOWHERE ELSE. VT_API_KEY, set
  on the machine that ships and nowhere in this repository. There is no
  parameter for it, so it cannot be typed on a command line that a shell then
  writes into its history, and there is no file for it to be committed in.
  It is never printed: the one place an error message is written scrubs the key
  out of the text first, because a VirusTotal key is 64 characters of hex and
  would otherwise ride out in a build log on the first 401.

  A machine without the key is the normal case, not a broken one. Djinn's and
  Ataxayk's machines have no key and every pull request build has none, so
  those say "skipped (VT_API_KEY not set)" and are done.

  WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT HAS A KEY, in this order, and why:

    1. Hashes the file itself. The hash of the bytes on disk is the only one
       worth having; -Sha256 from a caller that already hashed it is checked
       against this one and said out loud when the two differ.
    2. Asks VirusTotal whether it already holds that hash. A published
       installer is most of a gigabyte and a rerun of Publish-Installer is
       normal, so sending it twice is a long upload for nothing.
    3. Sends it, to the plain endpoint under 32 MB and to the one-time URL
       VirusTotal hands out for anything larger.

  Whatever happens, the line names the report address for the measured hash.
  That address works the moment the file is accepted, before any engine has
  finished, which is why nothing here waits for an analysis to complete: the
  analysis id the upload returns would only tell us the hash we already have.

  VIRUSTOTAL WILL NOT TAKE EVERYTHING. Its own limits, not ours: 32 MB on the
  plain endpoint, 650 MB through an upload URL, and nothing above that. The
  one-file installer has been over 650 MB, so that refusal is the expected
  outcome on some builds rather than a fault, and it is said as plainly as the
  rest. When it happens the page's link stays a not-found page until the file
  is under the cap or somebody sends it by hand.

  WHAT HAS BEEN MEASURED, and what has not. The paths that end in a line and
  exit 0 without a key, without a file, and with nothing answering, are what
  tests\test-virustotal-upload.ps1 runs. The upload itself is written from
  VirusTotal's API v3 documentation and has not been run from here: this
  repository holds no key, and a cloud agent may not send a build anywhere.
  The first real upload is Patrick's, on the machine that ships.

.PARAMETER Path
  The file to send. The installer exe today, and it takes any file, so Ship
  can pass a launcher zip later without this changing.

.PARAMETER Sha256
  The SHA-256 the caller has already measured, if it has. Optional. This
  script hashes the file itself either way and uses its own measurement; a
  value here that does not match is reported.

.PARAMETER Api
  The VirusTotal API v3 root. Only a test points this anywhere else, at an
  address where nothing answers, to prove that a dead network ends in a line
  and exit 0 rather than in a stopped release.

.PARAMETER TimeoutMinutes
  How long one call may take. The default covers a 650 MB upload on a home
  connection. This runs after the file is published, so a slow upload holds
  up nothing anybody is waiting for.

.EXAMPLE
  .\Publish-VirusTotal.ps1 -Path .\Thornswood-Setup.exe

.EXAMPLE
  .\Publish-VirusTotal.ps1 -Path .\Thornswood-Setup.exe -Sha256 $exeSha

  What Publish-Installer.ps1 runs, with the hash it has already measured.
