.SYNOPSIS
  Takes the records an engine.yml run made out of its log and writes them
  into this checkout's records\, for the pin pull request.

.DESCRIPTION
  Issue #3399. engine.yml records the fork's own build of a commit
  (records\server-build.json, records\client-build.json,
  records\client-licences.json and records\client-licences\), and since this
  repository's artifact storage was used up on 25 Oct it hands them back in
  its job's log instead of keeping them as an artifact (EngineRecords.ps1
  says what is carried, LogHandBack.ps1 how). This reads that log through
  gh, holds the records to what they must be, and writes them here.

  What is held first: the run is engine.yml's, in this repository, and ended
  green; exactly one of its jobs succeeded, and its log holds the records
  whole (their length and sha256); the records are the four things and no
  other; both build records name one fork commit; and that commit is the one
  this checkout's index pins engine\skymp to. So move the pin first, then run
  this. records\client-licences\ is then replaced whole.

  It reads GitHub through gh (any machine with gh, a cloud thread's too),
  writes nothing but the records, and sends nothing.

  Exit 0: the records are written. 1: they are not, and the last line says
  why.

.PARAMETER Run
  The engine.yml run's id.

.PARAMETER Gh
  The gh to run, for a harness. gh on the path otherwise.

.PARAMETER NoPause
  Exits without waiting for Enter.

.EXAMPLE
  git update-index --cacheinfo 160000,<fork commit>,engine/skymp
  .\scripts\release\Get-EngineRecords.ps1 -Run <the engine.yml run's id>
  The pin moved in the index, then the records of that run written beside it.
