.SYNOPSIS
  Builds the game files a merge release carries: dev's last release from the
  site, with this checkout's own files built over it, as one zip and the list
  of what is in it.

.DESCRIPTION
  The game part of the release merge-release.yml builds on every merge to
  main (#5179, plan parts 7 and 9). A Ship builds the same folder on the box
  (Ship.ps1 -FromFeed, #2754); this builds it on GitHub's runner from the
  merged commit, so the release carries the game files the commit makes and
  the box and the launcher can take them from one signed Release.

  WHAT IT DOES, in the order Ship -FromFeed does it:
    1. New-FeedRoot.ps1 -Channel dev stages every file the dev feed's last
       release left installed, each held to its sha256, and the six client
       files held to records\client-build.json (from either feed or CI's
       engine build of the pin, which Get-EngineArtifact.ps1 fetched).
    2. Build-Front.ps1 builds the front from the pinned fork commit and holds
       it to records\front-build.json.
    3. Go.ps1 -Game <root>\Game -SkipServer puts the front, the overlays and
       the plugins in, from this checkout.
    4. Ensure-ShipRequiredData and Save-ShipUiHashedAssets (Ship-Rules.ps1)
       put game\required-data and the front's hashed asset list in, as
       Publish-Update.ps1 does before it packs.
    5. Every file under Game, but *.pdb, goes into game.zip, and
       game-files.json lists each with its size and sha256.

  WHY NO OTHER FILTER. Each file in the folder is either one the dev feed's
  last release recorded, which Ship-Rules passed when that release was
  published, or one this checkout made in steps 2 to 4. New-FeedRoot removes
  anything else first. *.pdb never leaves a machine (Ship-Rules, launcher
  symbols), and Go.ps1 copies none, but the rule is held here as well.

  THE ZIP IS THE SAME FOR THE SAME FILES. Entries sorted by path (ordinal),
  forward slashes, one fixed time (2000-01-01), Optimal compression, and one
  name, so the workflow can tell an unchanged game part from the zip's sha256
  (MergeRelease.ps1) and a rebuild of the same files gives the same bytes.
  The list names the commit and the release it was built over, so it differs
  on every merge and is not what is compared.

  game-files.json:
      { schema: 1, commit, channel: "dev", from: <the record id staged>,
        files: [ { path: "Data/...", size, sha256 } ] }

  Talks to the site (https) and, through New-FeedRoot and Build-Front, to
  GitHub and the npm registry. Never to the VPS. Writes only under -Root and
  -Out, Build-Front's own scratch and local\thornswood-front.zip.

.PARAMETER Out
  The folder the zip and game-files.json go in. Made when missing.

.PARAMETER Root
  The folder the release is staged in. A folder under the system's temp
  folder unless given.

.PARAMETER Commit
  The commit the files are built from (40 hex), written into the list.
  git rev-parse HEAD unless given.

.PARAMETER SkipStage
  Tests only: builds the zip and the list from -Root as it is, without
  steps 1 to 4.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File scripts/release/Build-GameFiles.ps1 -Out $env:RUNNER_TEMP\game
  What merge-release.yml runs.
