.SYNOPSIS
  Signs a built binary, or says plainly that it is not signing and carries on.

.DESCRIPTION
  One implementation, called from Build-Launcher.ps1 and Package-Thornswood.ps1,
  so the launcher, the setup stub and the installer are all signed the same way
  or all left alone together.

  It does nothing unless records\signing\signing.json exists. That file is gitignored and
  lives only on a machine that holds a certificate, so Djinn's machine and every
  pull request build keep working exactly as they do today. A build that cannot
  sign is not a failed build.

  Why signing matters here is written out in installer\setup\Bootstrap.cs: SmartScreen
  builds reputation per file hash, and this project ships a new hash every
  release, so an unsigned installer starts from zero reputation every single
  time and warns forever. Signing moves the reputation to the certificate.

  Two shapes of signing.json are understood.

    Azure Artifact Signing, which is what entry 2 recommends. The service was
    called Trusted Signing and before that Azure Code Signing, so both older
    method names are accepted here and mean the same thing.

    Its certificates are valid for THREE DAYS. The timestamp is what keeps a
    signature valid after that, so it is not optional and the right authority
    is the default. Its metadata.json needs Endpoint, CodeSigningAccountName
    and CertificateProfileName, and the Endpoint must name the same region the
    account was created in, or signing fails with a 403 that does not say why.
      {
        "method": "artifactsigning",
        "dlib": "records\\signing\\client\\Azure.CodeSigning.Dlib.dll",
        "metadata": "records\\signing\\metadata.json",
        "timestampUrl": "http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com"
      }

    A dlib or metadata path that is not a full path is read from the repository
    folder. Since 25 September the signing setup lives there, not in C:\tools:
    records\signing\metadata.json is tracked, because it names the Azure account
    and holds no key or password, and records\signing\client is Microsoft's
    signing client, which git ignores (records\signing\README.md).

    A certificate already in the machine's store:
      {
        "method": "thumbprint",
        "thumbprint": "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567",
        "timestampUrl": "http://timestamp.digicert.com"
      }

  Never put a password or a key in that file. Trusted Signing does not need one,
  and a thumbprint names a certificate rather than carrying it.

.PARAMETER Path
  One or more files to sign. Missing files are reported and skipped rather than
  stopping the build.

.PARAMETER Required
  Fail instead of skipping. Covers all three reasons this would otherwise skip:
  no signing.json, "enabled": false, and a certificate profile that has not been
  filled in yet. For a real release.

  TO TURN SIGNING OFF while you are still setting it up, put "enabled": false in
  records\signing\signing.json. The config stays where it is and the build stops trying.
  A metadata.json whose CertificateProfileName is still a placeholder does the
  same thing on its own, because that is not a mistake, it is the middle of
  setting this up.

# ------------------------------------------------------------ half done ----
# Setting this up is not one step, and the middle of it used to break the build.
#
# On 18 September a release went out having printed "Signing failed. Nothing was
# published." The Azure account and signtool existed, signing.json was correct,
# and the certificate profile did not exist yet because the identity validation
# was still in progress. signtool answered 403 on every file. There is nothing
# wrong with being at that point; it is most of a working setup. It should not
# stop anybody shipping.
#
# So two ways out, and both say which one they took rather than going quiet.
# "enabled": false turns it off while keeping the config. A metadata.json whose
# CertificateProfileName is still a placeholder is the same situation and is
# detected rather than sent to the service to be refused.
#
# -Required overrides both, because a real release has to be signed and finding
# that out at the end is the point of that switch.
