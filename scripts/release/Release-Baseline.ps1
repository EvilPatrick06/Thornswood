  Release-Baseline.ps1

  What a release is diffed against, and the record each release publishes of
  what it left installed (#441).

      . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'Release-Baseline.ps1')

  WHY IT EXISTS. A release is the difference between this build and the last
  one published. Until #441 "the last one published" was published.json, a map
  of every file of ours to '<bytes>:<LastWriteTimeUtc.Ticks>' as the machine
  that last shipped saw it. Since #907 that file sits on the VPS beside the
  feed, so every machine reads the same one, but what it records is still one
  machine's memory: a file time. The same bytes on another machine, after a
  reinstall, or rewritten in place with the same content (hotfix 1.1.93 sent
  21 unchanged files, 12.5 MB, for exactly that) all read as changed. And when
  the store copy was missing the only way on was -Baseline, which records this
  build as already published whatever the feed really holds.

  So:
    - An entry is '<bytes>:<sha256>' of the file's own bytes (Get-BaselineEntry).
      The same bytes give the same entry on any machine.
    - An old '<bytes>:<ticks>' entry still compares the way it always did, the
      size and the file time, so the first release after the switch does not
      send the whole build again (Test-BaselineSame). Its new entry is a hash.
    - Every release writes the whole map as a file (ConvertTo-BaselineJson:
      sorted, ASCII, one shape on Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7, so two
      runs over the same tree give the same bytes), sends it to the site as an
      asset like a pack (/feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>), and names it in
      version.json as "baseline": { id, sha256, url, entries }. published.json
      in the store is written from the same map, so it has the same sha256.
    - Resolve-ReleaseBaseline decides what to diff against, in this order:
        1. the feed names a baseline and the store copy has its sha256: the
           store copy.
        2. the feed names one and the store copy is missing or is not it (a
           baseline send that failed, a feed put back by hand): that file,
           fetched from the site and checked against its sha256.
        3. the feed names none yet (feeds published before #441) and the store
           has one: the store copy, as before.
        4. otherwise: rebuilt by replaying every pack the feed lists, in order,
           from the site: each game file a pack carries at the size and sha256
           it carried it, each delete.txt line taken out. A file that never
           went out in a pack is missing from that and is sent again, so it can
           only send too much, never too little.
      The feed is what launchers install, so it wins over any copy on a disk.

  Every release's record also stays named in the feed, newest first, as
  "releases" (Add-FeedRelease), so Rollback-Feed.ps1 can put a channel back to
  one of them (#442).

  -SiteDir <folder> stands in for C:\Thornswood-Docs (the folder holding feed\
  and feed-dev\): assets are read from <folder>\<feed>\assets\<sha256> and
  nothing connects anywhere. Otherwise they are fetched from -SiteUrl over
  https, which needs no ssh. tests\test-release-baseline.ps1 drives it.
