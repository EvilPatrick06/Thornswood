  Install-Launcher.ps1
  Puts a launcher that Build-Launcher.ps1 has already built into an install,
  and does the things around it that only an install should do.

      .\scripts\release\Build-Launcher.ps1 -Root C:\Thornswood-DevBuild -OutDir $env:TEMP\tsl -NoPause
      .\scripts\release\Install-Launcher.ps1 -Root C:\Thornswood-DevBuild -From $env:TEMP\tsl -NoPause

  In order: closes a game and a launcher left running (Close-Launcher.ps1),
  copies Thornswood.exe from -From into <Root>\Launcher, writes
  the icon file and the shortcuts, tells Explorer to redraw, and clears
  Explorer's icon cache when the artwork is new.

  Split out of Build-Launcher.ps1 on 24 September, To Do List entry 243,
  "Build-Launcher.ps1 is an installer wearing a build script's name". Every
  compile check used to do all of this, closing whatever Skyrim was running on
  the machine before csc had even started. Ship.ps1 runs this after a build
  that worked, and Install-Thornswood.ps1 runs it for its launcher step.
  Nothing else should: something that only needs to know the launcher
  compiles calls Build-Launcher.ps1 and stops there.

  Without -From the exe is taken as already in place, which is what a hand
  build with Build-Launcher's default -OutDir leaves behind.

# A build names its shortcut after the build it is.
#
# MEASURED 22 SEPTEMBER on Patrick's machine. This block wrote Thornswood.lnk
# to the Desktop pointing at whatever -Root was, and -Root defaults to
# C:\Thornswood-DevBuild. So every compile, including the compile check a
# Claude runs and the one inside Ship, silently repointed the Desktop icon
# called "Thornswood" at the DEV launcher, which joins the dev server on
# 7787. The icon read 9/21 23:47:03, the minute the dev build was last
# compiled, and it had been pointing at the dev build ever since. Nothing
# said so, because the shortcut still had the right name and the right
# artwork. The Start menu entries were correct the whole time, which is why
# it went unnoticed: Thornswood.lnk there points at C:\Thornswood and
# Thornswood Dev.lnk at the dev build.
#
# The dev build gets its own name, so the two can never overwrite each other,
# and a dev build never touches the Desktop icon the play install owns.
#
# The dev build is the one folder C:\Thornswood-DevBuild, asked by its whole
# name like the play install below. MEASURED 20 OCTOBER on One (#2900): this
# asked only for a name ending in -DevBuild, and -match ignores case, so the
# dev release folder local\release-devbuild in the repository counted as the
# dev install. A dev Ship installs its launcher there, so every one rewrote
# the Desktop's Thornswood Dev.lnk to start the release folder's launcher
# (2:57 PM that day) instead of the dev build Patrick plays, and a Ship dry
# run's Play-DevBuild test folder did the same.
#
# Both installs are what Where.ps1 InstallDev and Install answer (#3031), so
# a developer whose launcher is on another drive gets the same shortcuts.
