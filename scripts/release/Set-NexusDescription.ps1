  Set-NexusDescription.ps1

  Adds a line to the description of one or more of our mods on Nexus Mods, or
  puts back a description from a file, and reads the page back to prove what
  Nexus kept (#2914).

      .\scripts\release\Set-NexusDescription.ps1 -Mod 192001,192762 -AddLine 'THIS MOD IS NOT MADE, GUARANTEED OR SUPPORTED BY ZENIMAX OR ITS AFFILIATES.' -WhatIf
      .\scripts\release\Set-NexusDescription.ps1 -Mod 192001 -From <a file this wrote before>

  WHY. #2829: Bethesda's Creation Kit licence asks every mod to carry one line,
  near the top, and both our mod pages need it. Patrick did page edits by hand
  on the website until 20 October.

  WHAT THE API HAS, read in https://api.nexusmods.com/openapi.yaml on
  20 October. v3 can write a description: editMod, PATCH /v3/mods/<id> with
  {"description": "..."}, "Full mod page description, in BBCode", stored "in
  the same encoding the mod page editor uses, so the result is identical to
  saving the same text from the website". v3 cannot read one: getMod answers
  only id, game_scoped_id, game_id and name, and no other v3 operation returns
  a description. So the description as it is now is read from the v2 GraphQL
  API, legacyModsByDomain { description }, which answers in the stored form.

  THE STORED FORM, measured on both our pages on 20 October through that
  GraphQL query: the BBCode as typed, with every line break stored as a line
  break followed by <br />, and every backslash as &#92;. The apostrophe was
  stored as it is. Nothing else was there to measure: neither page has < > &
  or a double quote. So this turns the stored form back into what the editor
  holds by exactly those two rules, refuses a description that has anything
  it cannot turn back exactly (any other < or &, or a carriage return), and
  refuses to add text with < > & or a double quote, whose stored form has not
  been seen.

  THE ORDER, for each mod: read it (GET /v3/games/<game>/mods/<mod> for the id
  the edit takes, GraphQL for the description), work out the new text, keep
  the description as it was in a file under the scratch folder
  (Get-ScratchDir.ps1 nexus-description), send the edit, and read the page
  back through GraphQL. What Nexus kept has to be exactly the stored form of
  what was sent, or this stops and says how to put the old one back with
  -From and that file. A mod whose description already has the line is left
  as it is.

  -WhatIf reads both and prints where the line goes, then stops.

  Only tested against the stand-in in tests\test-2914-nexus-scripts.ps1 until
  its first real run.

.PARAMETER Mod
  The mods' numbers on the website, as 192001,192762.

.PARAMETER Game
  The game's domain on Nexus. skyrimspecialedition unless said otherwise.

.PARAMETER AddLine
  The line to add, as its own paragraph.

.PARAMETER AfterLine
  How many lines of the description come before the new one. 1 unless said
  otherwise, so it goes straight under the heading.

.PARAMETER From
  A file holding a whole description as the editor holds it, which replaces
  the description: the file this keeps before an edit puts the page back.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
  Reads everything and says what it would send. Writes nothing.

.PARAMETER NoPause
  Does not wait for Enter at the end or on a stop.
