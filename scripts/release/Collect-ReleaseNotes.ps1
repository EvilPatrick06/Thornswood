  Collect-ReleaseNotes.ps1

      pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/release/Collect-ReleaseNotes.ps1 [-Since <tag or commit>] [-Until main] [-OutFile <file>]

  The note for the next release, joined from the "Release note:" lines of the
  pull requests merged since the last one (#5179), so nobody writes a note at
  release time from titles meant for the team.

  WHAT IT DOES. Since defaults to the newest release/dev/* tag. It asks GitHub
  for the commits between Since and Until on main, takes each squash merge's
  pull request number from the "(#N)" its subject ends with, reads that pull
  request's body, and joins the notes in merge order with Join-PrReleaseNotes
  (Note-Rules.ps1). The joined note is checked with the same rules Ship.ps1
  holds a note to before it is printed or written to OutFile.

  WHAT IT SAYS. Exit 0: the note is printed (and written to OutFile), ready
  for Ship's -Notes. Exit 3: every change since says none, so there is no
  note and nothing people would notice to release. Exit 2: a merged pull
  request has no Release note line (merged before #5179, or its body was
  changed after); each is named with its title, and its note is written into
  its body on GitHub so the next run reads it. Exit 1: GitHub could not be
  read, or the joined note breaks a rule. It changes nothing anywhere.

  PullsFile (for tests\test-pr-release-note.ps1) reads the pull requests from
  a JSON array of { number, title, body, author } instead of GitHub.
