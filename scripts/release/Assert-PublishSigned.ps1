  Assert-PublishSigned.ps1

  Helpers for the publish sign gate. Dot-source this from Ship.ps1 and
  Publish-Installer.ps1. Do not call it as a standalone entry: it only
  defines functions.

  WHY. Since 27 September launchers from ExpectedSigner on refuse an update
  that is not signed by that certificate (CONTRIBUTING, issue #390). Build and
  Package may still leave a local binary unsigned: Sign-Artifact.ps1 prints
  "not signing" and exits 0 when records\signing\signing.json is missing or disabled.
  That soft skip must not reach the site or the feed. Ship and Publish-
  Installer refuse instead.

  SCOPE. Site and feed publish only. Local Build-Launcher and Package
  -NoPublish stay soft. Build-Launcher still signs Thornswood.exe only and
  leaves setup-stub unsigned so OneFile attach can be signed afterwards (#813).

  SAME CHECK AS THE LAUNCHER (#912). After Get-AuthenticodeSignature says
  Valid and the Subject names ExpectedSigner, Get-PublishSignRefusal runs
  launcher\app\Signature.cs itself, the class every installed launcher uses to
  accept an update: Microsoft's Artifact Signing root, a timestamp, and
  Thornswood's durable identity in the certificate. So a Ship signed with any
  other profile or certificate stops here, before the feed, rather than being
  refused by everybody's launcher afterwards. It is compiled from the source
  under a namespace named for the source's hash, so a changed Signature.cs is
  never answered by an older copy already loaded in the same session.
