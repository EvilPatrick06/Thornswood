  Build-Server.ps1

  Compiles the game server out of our fork and puts the result where
  Deploy-Server.ps1 and Publish-Server.ps1 expect to find it.

  WHY THIS EXISTS

  Every engine change we make lives in the fork, engine\skymp in this
  repository (scripts\release\Where.ps1 Engine says where), on the branch
  thornswood/engine-changes, and until now the only way to turn one into a
  running server was to remember a cmake line and a Visual Studio project name
  and type them by hand. That is fine once. It is not fine when the next
  question is "is the fix in the build that is up there", because the answer
  depends on a command nobody wrote down.

  It also means a Claude working here cannot check its own C++ compiles. The
  permission rules in .claude\settings.json name whole script paths, in the
  same shape as the Deploy and Check lines already in there, so a script is
  the thing that can be allowed. A bare compiler invocation is not.

  WHAT IT BUILDS

  Every file the fork puts in the server (scripts\deploy\ServerBuild.ps1 names
  them), from the fork as it is checked out:
    skymp5-server      the Node addon, scam_native.node, and through it
                       skymp5-server-ts, the JavaScript half the server runs
                       (dist_back\skymp5-server.js and its map), and the
                       post-build copies of package.json, yarn.lock and
                       launch_server.bat
    skymp5-scripts     the compiled Papyrus in data\scripts
  Before that, skymp5-server's packages are installed from its yarn.lock
  (yarn install --frozen-lockfile), because the bundle carries them.
  Everything else in the solution is built as a dependency of those and
  nothing else is asked for, because the client runtime is a separate build
  with its own record (records\client-build.json, Sync-Client.ps1).

  THE JAVASCRIPT HALF IS ALWAYS BUILT AGAIN (#1214). Since fork #30 (#1236)
  the fork's CMake reruns the yarn install and build-ts when a .ts file under
  skymp5-server\ts, package.json, yarn.lock or the TypeScript settings are newer than the
  bundle, so a package bump reaches the bundle on any full build. A bundle
  copied in from another build with a newer date would still be taken as
  current, so the bundle and its map are still removed before the build, and
  the build has to write them from what is checked out. esbuild writes the same bytes for the same sources, so this
  costs about ten seconds and changes nothing when nothing changed.
  New-ServerBuildRecord.ps1 then ties every file to the clone before it
  records any of them.

  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

  It does not configure a new build folder. The build folder already carries a
  CMakeCache from a previous configure, and a first configure is a different
  job with different arguments. If the cache is missing this says so and stops
  rather than guessing at a configure line. A folder that is configured is
  generated again over its own cache (cmake <build folder>, every setting kept)
  before the compile, so a source file the fork added since is in the build
  (#2157).

  It does not deploy, it does not talk to the VPS, and it does not touch the
  game folder. It installs the server's packages, compiles and, unless told
  not to, updates the build record.

  HOW MANY AT ONCE (#1203). MSBuild compiles as many projects at once as the
  memory free allows, two compilers each, the same as Build-Engine.ps1
  (EngineJobs.ps1 says how many and why), or -Jobs of them. A bare /m started
  one per core and ran a busy machine out of memory. A compile that runs out
  anyway says so and gives the line to build with fewer.

  A fork under a path with an & in it (every worktree here) is built through
  the drive letter it was configured through, the way Build-Engine.ps1 does
  it: -Fork K:\<fork>. MSBuild refuses a cache configured through another path.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\release\Build-Server.ps1
    .\scripts\release\Build-Server.ps1 -Configuration Debug
    .\scripts\release\Build-Server.ps1 -NoRecord      compile only, leave the record alone
    .\scripts\release\Build-Server.ps1 -Jobs 2        two projects at a time, whatever is free

  Exit code 1 if Visual Studio or yarn is not installed, if the build folder
  has not been configured, if the packages or the compile fail, or if a file
  it was supposed to produce is not there afterwards.
