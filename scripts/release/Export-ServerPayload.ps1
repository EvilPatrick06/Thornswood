  Export-ServerPayload.ps1

  Packages everything the VPS needs into one zip. Run on the build machine.

  The VPS has Node but no build toolchain, so nothing is compiled there. What
  goes across is the built server plus the plugin files its load order names,
  with the absolute paths rewritten for where they will live on the VPS.

  What goes, and nothing else (#1214):
    every server file records\server-build.json lists, each held to its hash
    first: scam_native.node, dist_back\skymp5-server.js and its map,
    package.json, yarn.lock, launch_server.bat and data\scripts
    (scripts\deploy\ServerBuild.ps1 says which and why)
    gamemode.js and thornswood-build.json, ours
    server-settings.json, rewritten below
    server-build.json, the record itself, for the installer to hold them again
  Whatever else sits in the build folder stays there and is named: an old
  settings copy, a gamemode backup, a manifest the server wrote while it ran
  here. Until #1214 everything in the folder went, so a binary or a
  JavaScript half from any build went with it.

  Deliberately left out:
    scam_native.pdb        73 MB of debug symbols, useless on the VPS
    world/                 the save. The VPS starts with a fresh world; copying
                           a local one across would import a character nobody
                           on that server made.
    *.bsa                  the server reads plugin records, not archives. If a
                           Papyrus script turns out to be missing, that is the
                           thing to revisit.

  Kept despite its size: skymp5-server.js.map, 10 MB. Without it every stack
  trace from the server points at minified bundle offsets.
