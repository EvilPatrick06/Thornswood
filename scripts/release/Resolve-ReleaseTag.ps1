  Resolve-ReleaseTag.ps1

  Says which commit a launcher release builds, or refuses (#2202). The release
  workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) can be started by hand with a free
  form tag input. It used to hand that string straight to actions/checkout and
  draft the release against the run's own SHA. A branch name, a bare SHA, a tag
  on a commit that never reached main, or a tag that has moved could then be
  built and labelled as a release, with provenance that did not match.

      . .\scripts\release\Resolve-ReleaseTag.ps1
      $commit = Resolve-ThornswoodReleaseTag -Tag v1.2.3 -RepoDir . [-ExpectedSha <sha>] [-MainRef origin/main]

  The tag has to be named v<version>, exist as a tag (refs/tags, not a branch
  or a SHA), point at a commit, and that commit has to be on -MainRef. With
  -ExpectedSha (a tag push's handover passes the commit the tag named when it
  was pushed, #3930; a manual run may pass one) the commit has to be that one
  as well. Anything else throws, naming the tag and why. Returns the full commit SHA. Reads git only; changes nothing.
  Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.

  NO RELEASE IS BUILT FROM A COMMIT OFF MAIN (#3890). An expected SHA used to
  stand in for the main check, and a tag push always passes one, so a v tag
  pushed on a branch commit was built and signed without that commit ever
  going through a pull request (two trial tags were, in September and
  October). Patrick settled it on 27 Oct: never. The expected SHA now only
  narrows which commit on main; it never lets a commit off main through.
