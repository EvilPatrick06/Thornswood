.SYNOPSIS
  Builds the front, the in-game page Data\Platform\UI comes from, from the
  fork at the pinned commit, into local\thornswood-front.zip.

.DESCRIPTION
  The front is the fork's skymp5-front, built by webpack: build.js, the page
  and the hashed fonts, pictures and sounds build.js names. Go.ps1 unpacks
  local\thornswood-front.zip into Data\Platform\UI, and from there every
  release carries it.

  Until 20 October that zip was built on One from nobody knew which commit,
  and nothing checked it. Measured that day (#1317): it predated the fork's
  #40, so the live release still shipped DIN Pro and Futura PT, which nobody
  may redistribute, as four hashed .ttf files. Patrick's A on #2754 (Ships
  from the feed, in the cloud) needs every file a release carries to be built
  from something tracked, so the front is built here, from the commit
  engine\skymp is pinned to, the same commit records\client-build.json names
  (engine\README.md, One engine), and recorded in records\front-build.json.
  Go.ps1 refuses a zip that is not the recorded build.

  WHAT IT DOES
    1. Takes skymp5-front out of the fork at the commit with git archive, with
       line endings as committed, so Windows and Linux build the same bytes.
    2. yarn 1.22.22 (through npx) installs the locked packages and builds.
       Needs node and the npm registry; nothing else on the machine.
    3. Compares what it built with records\front-build.json. The same: it
       writes local\thornswood-front.zip, one fixed time on every entry, so
       the zip is the same on every machine. Different: it writes nothing and
       says which files differ.
  -Record writes records\front-build.json from this build instead of
  comparing, for when the pin moved: commit it with the pin.

  Read only except for the zip, the record with -Record, its own scratch
  folder, which it removes, and engine\skymp when this checkout never
  fetched it (a cloud checkout): then it fetches the pinned commit there with
  git submodule update --init --depth 1. Never talks to the VPS.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release\Build-Front.ps1
  Builds the pinned front and puts the zip in local\ when it is the recorded build.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh scripts/release/Build-Front.ps1 -Fork ../skymp -Record
  After a pin move: builds from another clone of the fork and records the build.
