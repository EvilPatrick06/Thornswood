  WHICH FOLDER (#1692). The one this machine builds the channel's release
  from, as Ship takes it: -Root, or else what Where.ps1 ShipRoot or ShipRootDev
  answers (the folder Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 -Root recorded, or the launcher
  install, and for dev that with -DevBuild on the end). A folder Vortex
  deploys into is a gap, because Ship refuses it before anything is built.

  A SHIP ROOT IS NOT AN INSTALL (#2603). Since #2019 that folder is a ship
  root: Update-ShipRoot.ps1, the step every Ship runs first, makes or
  refreshes its game folder, and its launcher is never started. So no fix
  here says to install Thornswood or to open a launcher in it. A main Ship
  puts the launcher it builds into the folder itself, so a main root with
  none yet is not a gap; only a dev Ship refuses a folder with no Launcher
  folder, and only the install rule's dev folder has a step that makes one.

  WHY IT EXISTS. Ship.ps1 has fourteen ways to refuse, and every one of them is
  found by running Ship and being stopped, usually after the launcher has
  already been compiled and the version already bumped. That is fine on the one
  machine where everything has been in place for months. It is the whole
  problem on a second machine, where the answer to "can I ship" was: try it and
  read whichever refusal comes first, fix that, try again. Djinn has never
  shipped, and nothing written down says what he would need.

  This asks every question Ship asks, before Ship does, and changes nothing.
  Each gap prints the exact command that closes it. It does not ship, publish,
  deploy, push or write anything outside its own output.

  NOT READY means something that would stop a Ship, and nothing else. A Ship
  never builds the engine, so the fork in engine\skymp is a note, not a check:
  what it needs is the game folder holding the recorded client, or a build
  that matches records\client-build.json for it to copy in (issue #946). What
  only a main release asks for, the setup stub -Package attaches to and the
  server build the live deploys send (issue #932), prints as WARN on main and
  leaves the verdict alone.

  It is deliberately not part of Ship. Ship's refusals stay where they are:
  they are the gate, and a gate that can be satisfied by a different script is
  not a gate. This is the map, not the key.

# THE LAUNCHER IN THE RELEASE FOLDER (#2603). What Ship.ps1 does with
# <root>\Launcher, read from the code:
#   - main: nothing is asked of it before the build. A Ship that builds a
#     launcher takes the exe CI built for main's tag, signs it, and puts it
#     there with Install-Launcher.ps1, which makes the folder. A Ship that
#     keeps the feed's launcher publishes none, so it never reads the folder
#     either. Until 17 Oct this asked for Launcher\Thornswood.exe on main too,
#     and its fix was a person's install from the site, which is wrong for a
#     ship root (its launcher is never started) and asked for something no main
#     Ship needs: main's own root, local\release-main, made on 16 Oct by
#     Update-ShipRoot.ps1, has no Launcher folder and was NOT READY on it.
#   - dev: "No dev build at <root>" unless <root>\Launcher is there, the folder,
#     not the exe, before anything else, but only when the folder is the
#     install rule's (#2662): no -Root, and ship-roots.json records no dev
#     folder (Get-DevRootRefusal). The main launcher's Settings page (The dev
#     build) makes it, and only in <its own folder>-DevBuild (DevBuild.Root),
#     the install rule's dev folder. A folder named by -Root or recorded with
#     Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 -Root is made by Update-ShipRoot.ps1, which makes
#     no Launcher folder, and a dev Ship does not ask it for one: its launcher
#     step makes it. Publish-Update.ps1 asks only when it is given no -Root,
