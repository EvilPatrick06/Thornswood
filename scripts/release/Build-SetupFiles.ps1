.SYNOPSIS
  Builds the files the launcher's Velopack package carries beside Game for
  the install's first start, and the list of them.

.DESCRIPTION
  Velopack's Setup.exe puts the launcher and its package on the PC, and the
  launcher's first start runs the install (launcher\app\InstallSteps.cs,
  #4824). That reads, from the package's own folder, what the old setup
  payload carried beside the game files (Package-Thornswood.ps1 until #4825):

      config.json       the -Channel feed's server, voice and site, the
                        fields New-FeedRoot.ps1 writes, and Channel, which
                        picks the launcher's feed and its Velopack channel;
                        the install merges it into the install folder's own
      profile\          plugins.txt and loadorder.txt, the reference load
                        order of the release the game files were built over
                        (dev's, its :golden:), fetched from the site by their
                        sha256, as Package-Thornswood -FromFeed took them
                        (#3412), so the load order matches the files
      applied.txt       every pack the -Channel feed lists, so a fresh
                        install does not offer the whole history of the
                        project as pending updates (the install writes it
                        only when the install folder has none)
      SOURCE CODE.txt,  where the source of the SkyMP files in Game is, the
      GPL-3.0.txt,      GNU GPL and AGPL texts, and the licence texts of the
      AGPL-3.0.txt,     libraries inside those files (Source-Notice.ps1, kind
      licences\         setup; #421, #3099)
      *-LICENSE.txt,    the licence texts of the libraries inside the
      *-NOTICES.txt,    launcher and shipped with it, from installer\licences
      Velopack-Rust-    (its README.txt says where each is from;
      crates.txt        InstallSteps.LicenceFiles names them; #4823)

  merge-release.yml packs every one of them at the top of the package, beside
  Thornswood.exe and Game, and setup-files.<channel>.json lists each with its
  size and sha256. That list goes into the Release's signed manifest, and the
  launcher refuses an update package holding a file beside Game that the list
  does not name with those bytes (launcher\app\VeloPackage.cs).

      setup-files.<channel>.json: { schema: 1, commit, channel,
                          from: <the record id the game files were built over>,
                          files: [ { path: "profile/plugins.txt", size, sha256 } ] }

  ONE PER CHANNEL. Every merge release that makes a package packs it for dev
  and for main from the same launcher and game files (merge-release.yml), and
  this runs once for each: config.json and applied.txt are the channel's
  own, and everything else is the same. The game files are always built over
  dev's last release, so the record checked and the load order are dev's for
  both.

  READ ME FIRST.txt is not carried: it told people which of Setup.bat and
  Install.bat to run, and both retired with #4824.

  WHAT IT REFUSES. A -GameRoot New-FeedRoot did not stage (no record), a dev
  feed whose record is not the one staged there (a Ship published between the
  two steps: run the workflow again), a record with no reference load order,
  and a golden list that does not hash to its name.

  Talks to the site (https) for the feed and the two lists; never to the VPS.
  Writes only under -Out.

.PARAMETER Out
  The folder: files\ holds what is packed, setup-files.<channel>.json the
  list. Emptied first.

.PARAMETER GameRoot
  The folder Build-GameFiles.ps1 staged dev's last release in (its -Root),
  holding Game and record\record.json as New-FeedRoot.ps1 left them.

.PARAMETER Channel
  The Velopack channel the package is for, dev or main: whose server, voice,
  site and packs config.json and applied.txt carry.

.PARAMETER Commit
  The commit, 40 hex, written into the list. git rev-parse HEAD unless given.

.PARAMETER SiteDir
  A folder standing in for the site's root. Tests only.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh -File scripts/release/Build-SetupFiles.ps1 -Out $env:RUNNER_TEMP\setup-main -GameRoot $env:RUNNER_TEMP\game-root -Channel main
  What merge-release.yml runs for main's package, and with -Channel dev for dev's.
