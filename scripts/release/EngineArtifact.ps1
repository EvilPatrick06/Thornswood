  EngineArtifact.ps1

  CI's engine build of the pin, the public fork's own build of the commit
  (thornswood-engine-<commit>), made this machine's engine build after every
  file in it is held to the checkout's records. Issues #3047 and #3399.
  Dot-sourced by Get-EngineArtifact.ps1 and tests\test-3047-ci-engine-build.ps1.

  WHY. An engine build is not the same bytes twice (engine\README.md,
  "Rebuilding the same commit"), so records\client-build.json and
  records\server-build.json match only the one build they were made from. Since
  #459 that is CI's: engine.yml records the pin from the fork's own build of
  it. Until 21 Oct every script a Ship machine reads (Check-ShipReady,
  Sync-Client, Setup-ShipMachine, Update-ShipRoot, the Where.ps1 errors) still
  pointed at a fork build made on the machine itself, which can never match a
  record CI made. That night PR #3040 moved the pin to 1a7b6eec, One's
  recorded engine build was still a b6c76e45 worktree, and the dev Ship stopped
  at "the build is not the recorded one" while CI held the exact client.

  So a Ship machine records {"ci": true} in Where.ps1 EngineBuilds
  (Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 -EngineBuild ci), and its engine build is then
  Where.ps1 EngineArtifact: a folder of its own data named for the pin the
  checkout records. A pin move is a new folder, never a stale one, and the
  folder is filled by fetching, not by building. Sync-Client.ps1 fetches it
  when it needs the client and the folder is not there yet, so every Ship and
  Go does.

  FROM THE FORK, NOT FROM THIS REPOSITORY (#3399, Patrick's A of 26 Oct).
  Until then the fetch took engine.yml's own artifact, engine-<commit 12>,
  out of this repository's artifact storage. That storage is metered over the
  month and is private, and on 25 Oct it filled: engine.yml's upload was
  refused (run 40249618462), and after the prune (#3410) it stayed refused,
  because what is used up is time stored, which a delete does not give back.
  The fork, ThornswoodRP/skymp, is public, so its artifacts cost nothing and
  count against no quota, and every push to thornswood/engine-changes keeps
  the build as thornswood-engine-<commit> for 90 days (ForkEngineBuild.ps1).
  engine.yml makes the records from exactly that build, so those are the
  bytes the records name, and a Ship machine takes them from there.

  WHICH BUILD. A green push build of the commit to thornswood/engine-changes
  in the fork itself whose artifact is still kept, and whose files are the
  ones the checkout's records name: the newest such one that passes WHAT IS
  HELD below. A commit can have more than one (a build run again in the
  fork), and a build run again is new bytes, so only the one the records
  were made from passes. Find-EngineArtifact lists every one as Candidates,
  newest first, and Get-EngineArtifact.ps1 holds each in turn and takes the
  first that passes. None: the Why says what the fork has of it.

  WHAT IS HELD before it is this machine's engine build. The trust is the
  checkout's records, in git; the fork's build is taken only because it is
  those bytes:
    - fork-build.json is of this commit, that run, a push to the branch in the
      fork, and names every file in the download with its sha256 and size,
      and no other file is there (Get-ForkEngineBuildProblems, the check
      engine.yml makes before it records the build);
    - each client file records\client-build.json names is under
      build\dist\client with that size and sha256, and no other file is;
    - the server files under build\dist\server are the ones
      records\server-build.json names (Get-ThornswoodServerBuildProblems, the
      check every deploy makes), and the server zip made from them
      (New-ThornswoodServerBuildArtifact, which holds them again) comes back
      out through Expand-ThornswoodStoredServerBuild, which holds each again.
  Anything wrong throws one sentence and nothing is put in place.

  WHERE IT GOES. Where.ps1 EngineArtifact, laid out as an engine build so
  ClientDist and ServerDist are under it as for any other:
    build\dist\client\<the record's paths>   the six client files
    build\dist\server\...                    the server files the record lists
    artifact\server\server-<...>.zip, .json  the server build as the box's
                                             store keeps it, which
                                             Deploy-Server.ps1 -ServerBuild
                                             and Publish-Server.ps1 send
    artifact\fork-build.json                 the fork's own list of its build
    engine-artifact.json                     which build, which run, when
  It is made in a folder beside it and moved into place whole, so a folder
  there is one that passed.

  Keep it Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh alike. It reads nothing over the
  network itself: Get-EngineArtifact.ps1 hands it gh and the registry's
  HTTP (New-EnginePackageHttp), the harness stand-ins.

<#
  THE FORK'S PACKAGE OF THE BUILD (#5152). Since fork #131 every push build
  of thornswood/engine-changes is also kept as
  ghcr.io/<owner>/thornswood-engine:<commit>, the same folder as one
  zip (the fork's misc\thornswood\Push-EnginePackage.ps1), kept until
  somebody deletes it and read with no account. An artifact goes after 90
  days, so until #5152 a pin older than that could not be shipped again, and
  reverting a pin pull request did not bring its engine back. The package is
  asked first; it is the first push build of the commit, the one engine.yml
  recorded unless the fork's build was run again, and it is held to the
  records exactly as an artifact is (WHAT IS HELD). One that is not the
  records' build is passed over for the artifacts, and a commit built before
  fork #131 has none.

  $Http is called as  & $Http <url> <headers hashtable> <file>  and returns
  the HTTP status as a number, with the body written to <file> when it is
  200; a failure to reach the registry throws, and that is not "there is
  none". New-EnginePackageHttp makes the real one; a harness passes its own.

# is under evilpatrick06, which keeps it, and one from after is under
# thornswoodrp. A package is never in both, so the two are asked in turn,
