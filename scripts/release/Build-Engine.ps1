  Build-Engine.ps1

  Takes a machine from a fresh clone to a built engine: the SkyMP server and
  the client runtime, out of the fork in engine\skymp. Any developer runs it
  on their own machine; nothing about it is Patrick's.

      .\scripts\release\Build-Engine.ps1                first time: checks, configures, builds
      .\scripts\release\Build-Engine.ps1 -Check         says what is missing, changes nothing
      .\scripts\release\Build-Engine.ps1 -Jobs 2        two projects at a time, whatever is free

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 25 September a dev Ship worked only on Patrick's
  machine: Ship checks the client runtime against records\client-build.json,
  and the only built engine was his, configured by hand from a line in
  engine\README.md that no script ran (issue #545). Patrick, asked whether to
  work around it: "Can't we just add the ability and instructions for people
  to do that instead of doing workarounds". This is the ability;
  engine\README.md is the instructions.

  WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER
    1. Checks the tools: Visual Studio 2022 or its Build Tools with MSBuild
       ("Desktop development with C++"), CMake (the one in Visual Studio is
       found), git, node and yarn. Says exactly what to install for anything
       missing and stops before building.
    2. Fetches the fork at the commit this repository pins, and the fork's own
       submodules (vcpkg among them).
    3. Configures engine\skymp\build if it has never been configured, with
       the settings engine\README.md gives (read off the shipping machine's
       CMakeCache, 24 Sep; the option names checked against the fork's
       CMakeLists.txt on 25 Sep). SKYRIM_DIR is the game folder with
       SkyrimSE.exe in it: C:\Thornswood\Game unless -SkyrimDir says another.
       The first configure builds every vcpkg library and takes a long time.
       A fork whose path has an & in it is reached through a drive letter of
       its own (subst) for configure and build, removed again at the end by
       the last run on it; two builds at once each get their own (#1993).
    4. Builds everything, Release. After the first time only what changed is
       rebuilt, so a fork change that touches the client bundle is quick.
       It compiles as many projects at once as the memory free allows, two
       compilers each, or -Jobs of them (EngineJobs.ps1 says how many and
       why, issue #1203). A compile that runs the machine out of memory says
       so and gives the line to build with fewer.
    5. Compares the six client files with records\client-build.json, the check
       Ship makes, and says whether this build is the recorded one.

  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never changes a record: when the build is not the
  recorded one it says so, and New-ClientBuildRecord.ps1 is the step for a
  deliberate engine change (engine\README.md). It sends nothing anywhere and
  never touches the game folder; Sync-Client.ps1 copies the files in.
