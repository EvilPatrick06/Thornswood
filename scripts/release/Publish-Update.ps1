  Publish-Update.ps1

  Diffs the current build against the last published state, packs only what
  changed, sends it to the site (thornswood.net/feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>,
  #897), and updates version.json so everyone's launcher picks it up.

  First time:   .\Publish-Update.ps1 -Baseline
  After that:   .\Publish-Update.ps1 -Notes "Swapped the map mod"
  Launcher:     .\Publish-Update.ps1 -Launcher -Notes "New launcher"

  The feed and its baseline are received from the VPS at the start and sent
  back at the end (Feed-Store.ps1, #907). Nothing here uses GitHub.

# ---- what a removal is allowed to be --------------------------------------
#
# A removal becomes a line in delete.txt, and every launcher that takes the
# pack deletes that file. That is right for a mod we dropped. It is a disaster
# for a file the collection provides, because the collection lives in the same
# folder now, so deleting it takes the mod off somebody's machine while Vortex
# still believes it deployed it.
#
# Not hypothetical. The first release published after the move to the Steam
# copy carried 28,833 removals: the previous state described the old Game
# folder, the new scan excluded everything Vortex provides, and every one of
# those files therefore looked deleted. It had to be pulled back out of
# version.json by hand before anybody opened a launcher.

# ---- and the ones that are deleted whether they were here or not ----------
#
# Leaving a file out of a pack stops it reaching NEW machines and does nothing
# for the ones that already have it, which are the machines the problem is on.
#
# 22 September, map.swf: excluded by Test-ShipOtherServer, released, and the
# pack carried no delete.txt at all, so every tester who already had the game
# kept the broken file and kept the SkyUI error box. It had only helped the
# people who did not have the problem.
#
# The ordinary diff could not catch it. It left the game folder, which is
# normally a removal, but the filter above reads the launcher's record of what
# Vortex provides and that record lists map.swf even though Vortex's own
# deployment manifest does not. So it was taken for a collection file and
# dropped. THAT GUARD IS RIGHT AND STAYS; this is the deliberate override
# beside it.
#
# Added AFTER the collection filter on purpose, so nothing here can be removed
# by it. See $ShipDeleteAlways in Ship-Rules.ps1 for what may go on the list.
#
# The removals this build really made are counted first. The rule paths go in
# every pack that goes out, but they are not a reason to send one: counted as

# The next release counted "29,063 added or changed (11,368.1 MB)" and was one

# only on the releases where they happened to move and absent from every other
# one. On 22 September the launcher learned to repair a missing client file and
# there was nothing on the feed to repair FROM: the four packs published after
# the client was recorded that morning were 3 MB, 0, 0 and 0, and
# SkyrimPlatformImpl.dll alone is 15.6 MB. It had to be forced by clearing six
# entries out of the publish baseline by hand.
#
# That worked and it is not a mechanism. So the runtime gets its own asset and
# its own line in version.json, and ClientRuntime.Heal asks for it by address
# instead of walking forty updates hoping to trip over it.

# 103 of them today, while Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 deliberately drops light plugins
# from the server's list and cascades that drop to anything mastering them, so
# the two disagree by construction and uploading one over the other breaks the
# server rather than fixing it. Nothing packed _dist\server into a release, so
# the file only ever sat on the shipping machine waiting to tempt somebody. And
# the mechanism it named, ModCheck comparing against Data/loadorder.txt, exists
# nowhere else in this repo: the server's list lives in the loadOrder array of
# server-settings.json, which Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 writes.
#
# What replaces it is a check rather than a file. Nothing here can fix a stale
# server list, because computing it means the light plugin cascade and that
# logic belongs in one place. So this says whether the list the server is
# configured with is older than the one just published, which is the whole
