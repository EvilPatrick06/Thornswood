.SYNOPSIS
  Records every server file the fork builds and the one commit they were built
  from, into records\server-build.json.

.DESCRIPTION
  The server binaries have always been copied rather than rebuilt, and nothing
  mapped them back to source. On 2026-09-17 the only evidence that the shipped
  scam_native.node contained the committed server changes was that its file date
  was six minutes later than the last edit to ScampServer.cpp. A file date is not
  a build record.

  Run this after every rebuild of skymp (Build-Server.ps1 runs it). Deploy-Server,
  Export-ServerPayload, Publish-Server and the installer on the box read the
  result and refuse any server file whose hash is not the recorded one, so a
  stale or unknown build cannot reach the VPS by accident.

  EVERY SERVER FILE, NOT ONLY THE BINARY (#1200, #1214). The record lists
  every file the fork's build puts in the server (scripts\deploy\ServerBuild.ps1
  names them and says why), each with its hash and the one fork commit. It is
  written only for files this can tie to that commit:
    dist_back\skymp5-server.js(.map)  every TypeScript source the source map
                                      carries is the fork's, word for word, and
                                      every package it bundled that is on disk
                                      (server-bundle-sources.js); the fork's
                                      packages are the ones its yarn.lock names
                                      (yarn check --integrity); the bundle
                                      names that map
    package.json, yarn.lock           the fork's skymp5-server ones, byte for byte
    data\scripts\*                    the fork's compiled Papyrus, byte for byte,
                                      every one of them: build\skymp5-scripts\pex
                                      when the build compiled it there, each
                                      newer than its .psc, otherwise the
                                      committed skymp5-scripts\pex (#1220)
    launch_server.bat                 the one the fork's configure wrote
    scam_native.node                  built from the clone, newer than its sources
  Anything else stops it and nothing is written.

  Read only except for the one file it writes. It never starts anything and never
  talks to the VPS.

.PARAMETER Dist
  Where the build puts the server. The same default Deploy-Server.ps1 uses.

.PARAMETER Clone
  The skymp clone, read for the commit the files came from and held to.

.PARAMETER Out
  The record to write. Committed to this repo, so a reader can answer what the
  live server is running without guessing from timestamps.

.PARAMETER BuiltBy
  The run that built -Dist on another machine, from the commit -Clone is at:
  the fork's own build on GitHub's runner, which engine.yml takes (#459,
  ForkEngineBuild.ps1). The clone was checked out after that build, so its
  files' dates say nothing about it; each time the build is held to is the
  commit's own time instead, and a file written before the commit was made
  stops it. Without it, the files' dates in the clone are read as they are on
  the machine that built them.
