.SYNOPSIS
  Records what the client runtime is and which fork commit it was built from,
  into records\client-build.json.

.DESCRIPTION
  Until 20 September the SkyMP client Thornswood shipped was whatever another
  server's launcher had last written into the Steam copy's Data folder: the
  bundle, MpClientPlugin.dll, both SkyrimPlatform DLLs, the CEF host and
  TESModPlatform.pex, all of them another launcher's builds, copied into
  Thornswood's own folder on every rebuild and then patched by text. None of it
  came from Vortex, measured against the deployment manifest, and none of it
  came from here.

  The client is built from the fork now, engine\skymp in this repository, with
  npx webpack in skymp5-client for the bundle and the native build for the
  rest. This records the six files that build produces which differ from
  upstream, by hash, against the fork commit they came from. Sync-Client.ps1
  reads the record and refuses to copy a file whose hash is not the recorded
  one, so a stale or unknown build cannot reach the game folder, and from there
  a pack, by accident. Ship-Rules.ps1 reads it too: a runtime file whose hash
  is in this record is ours, and one that is not is somebody else's.

  Run this after every rebuild of the client. Read only except for the one
  file it writes. It never starts anything and never talks to the VPS.

.PARAMETER Dist
  Where the client build puts its output.

.PARAMETER Clone
  The skymp clone, read for the commit the build came from.

.PARAMETER Out
  The record to write. Committed to this repo.

.PARAMETER BuiltBy
  The run that built -Dist on another machine, from the commit -Clone is at
  (the fork's own build on GitHub's runner, #459, ForkEngineBuild.ps1). The
  clone's sources were checked out after that build, so their dates say
  nothing about it: the build is held to the commit's own time instead, and
  one older than the commit is refused.
