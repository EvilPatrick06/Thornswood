  EngineRecords.ps1

  The records engine.yml makes for a pin, carried from the run to the pin
  pull request in the run's log (#3399). Dot-sourced by
  .github\workflows\engine.yml and scripts\release\Get-EngineRecords.ps1;
  tests\test-3399-engine-records.ps1.

  WHAT IS CARRIED. The four things a pin pull request takes from the run
  (engine\README.md, The engine built in CI):
    records\server-build.json
    records\client-build.json
    records\client-licences.json
    records\client-licences\<port>.txt, every text and no other file
  in one zip, entries named records/<...> with /, in ordinal order, which
  LogHandBack.ps1 prints between the ENGINE-RECORDS lines. The engine itself
  is not carried: it is the fork's own build, which the public fork keeps
  (EngineArtifact.ps1 says why and how a Ship machine takes it).

  WHAT IS HELD before they are written into a checkout. Only those names,
  each a plain path under records\; the two build records parse and name one
  fork commit (the server record's source.commit, which the client record's
  forkCommit starts); and that commit is the one the checkout's engine\skymp
  is pinned to in its index, so the records go in with the pin move and
  never under another commit. Then records\client-licences\ is replaced
  whole, so a text the new build no longer has goes.

  Keep it Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh alike.
