  CollectionRevision.ps1

  Which collection revision a release is built against, and the one place
  that number comes from (#3597).

      $r = Get-ShipRecordedCollectionRevision -RepoDir <repo>
      $why = Get-ShipCollectionRevisionProblem -RepoDir <repo> -Built <n> -Slug <slug> -Source <words> -Remedy <words>
      $why = Get-ShipNewestRevisionProblem -RepoDir <repo>

  records\collection-plugins.json names the collection and the revision its
  plugins are, and both deploys already hold every plugin they send to it
  (CollectionPlugins.ps1, #2019). It is the revision Nexus gives people and the
  servers are deployed against, so it is what the feed's collectionRevision
  says, and the launcher holds Play until an install is on it (Shell.cs,
  CollectionProblem).

  Until #3597 the feed's number came from somewhere else: a Ship from One wrote
  the revision One's Vortex had installed, and a Ship from the feed carried the
  last release's. One's Vortex stayed on revision 2 while revisions 3, 4 and 5
  were made and published without it, so both feeds said 2 from 21 to 27 Oct,
  and a launcher on revision 2 read as current and was let in (Patrick, 27 Oct:
  "my local collection is on #2 and the launcher never made me update to the
  newest one and still let me in").

  So a release names the recorded revision, and it may only be built from a
  source that is on it: One's Vortex for a Ship from One (its plugin list, load
  order and bodies are read there), the last release for a Ship from the feed
  (it carries that release's plugin list). When the source is on another
  revision, or cannot say which, the Ship stops, naming both numbers, before
  anything is built. It never writes the source's number instead.

  And the record has to be the newest revision published on Nexus (#4068), so
  a release is never built on an old one and every launcher is held to the
  newest: Get-ShipNewestRevisionProblem asks Nexus (NexusPublished.ps1) and
  stops a release while the record is behind it or ahead of it.
  Check-CollectionRevisions.ps1 holds Nexus, the record and both feeds to each
  other every hour, and files the rebuild on the board when they part.
