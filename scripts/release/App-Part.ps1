  App-Part.ps1

  Makes the zip of one app the box deploy agent puts in from a build Release
  (#5190, #5187): the site, the Discord bot or the voice service, each as the
  folder it lands in on the box holds it. Merge release (merge-release.yml)
  runs this for each app on every merge and puts the zip on the Release as
  its own part; the agent stages it, checks it, and swaps it in
  (tools/DeployAgent/App.cs, docs/DEPLOY-AGENT.md).

      pwsh -File scripts/release/App-Part.ps1 -Part site    -Out <folder>\site.zip
      pwsh -File scripts/release/App-Part.ps1 -Part discord -Out <folder>\discord.zip
      pwsh -File scripts/release/App-Part.ps1 -Part voice   -Out <folder>\voice.zip

  WHAT EACH CARRIES, by the path it has in the app's folder on the box:

    site     server.js, public\*, data\site\*   (C:\Thornswood-Docs)
             What Deploy-Docs.ps1 sends as the app, and the public pages
             (-Site), which nobody edits in the browser. The documents, the
             boards and everything the site writes are the site's own and
             never ride a Release.
    discord  bot.py, _pyguard.py, trust.py, card.py, staff-channel.txt,
             requirements.txt, factions.json, assets\join-card.png
             (C:\Thornswood-Bot). The list Install-Bot.ps1 -CodeOnly sends.
             The token, the settings, the records and the libraries are the
             bot's own and never ride a Release.
    voice    voice-server.js, headlines.js, server-log.js
             (C:\Thornswood-Voice and C:\Thornswood-Voice-Dev). The list
             Install-Voice.ps1 sends; server-log.js is
             scripts\vps\Server-Log.js, which the voice task writes its log
             through.

  THE ZIP IS THE SAME BYTES FOR THE SAME FILES. Merge release tells whether
  an app changed by comparing this zip's sha256 with the same part of the
  newest build Release, so a zip that differed from run to run would deploy
  every app on every merge. So the entries are sorted by path (ordinal), each
  carries one fixed time and no file attributes, the paths use forward
  slashes, and every entry is compressed at one fixed level by .NET's own
  deflate. The files are read as git checked them out; .gitattributes keeps
  their line endings the same on every runner.

  Exit 0 with the zip written and one line naming it, its sha256 and its
  entries; exit 1 with the reason and no zip.

  Keep it ASCII.
