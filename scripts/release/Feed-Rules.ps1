  Feed-Rules.ps1

  Which packs on the update feed a launcher can actually download.
  Publish-Update.ps1 dot-sources this and refuses to add a pack that breaks the
  rule; Repair-Manifest.ps1 dot-sources it and takes the ones already on the
  feed back out. One rule, so the two can never disagree about it.

  THE RULE. A launcher reads version.json from the site feed on thornswood.net
  (until #907 it fell back to the repository the feed named as updateRepo, via
  the GitHub Contents API) and downloads every pack from the url the feed
  gives. So a pack has to be either:

    - an https asset on thornswood.net (or a subdomain), under
      /feed/assets/<sha256> or /feed-dev/assets/<sha256>, or
    - on a feed that still names an updateRepo, a release asset in it

  Anything else answers 404 to a launcher, and a pack that will not download
  stops the update, and Play stays off (Shell.cs skips a pack with NO url, but
  one whose url answers 404 fails the whole update).

  WHY IT EXISTS. Read off the releases clone on 24 September: 227 packs on the
  live feed, 164 of them (20260910-2345 to 20260914-1917) under
  /repos/EvilPatrick06/Thornswood/, the source repository, and 63 under
  Thornswood-Releases. The source repository is private and has no releases
  left at all: gh api answers 0 releases, and asset 556583849, the first of
  them, answers 404 even with Patrick's token. They were published there before
  releases moved to the public repository on 15 September, and the new feed was
  seeded from the old one with all 164 still on it. Fresh installs never notice
  because Package-Thornswood.ps1 seeds applied.txt with every id on the feed.
  A machine that loses applied.txt, or anything that replays the history, asks
  for all 164, the first one fails, and Play stays off.

  HOST CUTOVER (#649). Packs may also be served from thornswood.net under the
  locked URL shape confirmed with Website:

      https://thornswood.net/feed/version.json
      https://thornswood.net/feed-dev/version.json
      https://thornswood.net/feed/assets/<sha256>
      https://thornswood.net/feed-dev/assets/<sha256>

  Private-source GitHub assets and random hosts stay refused.

      Get-FeedRepo $doc              owner/name the feed's updateRepo names, or ''
      Get-FeedPackRepo $url          owner/name a pack url downloads from, or ''
      Test-HostFeedAssetUrl $url     true when url is a thornswood.net feed asset
      Get-HostFeedAssetUrl $sha $Dev build https://thornswood.net/feed[-dev]/assets/<sha>
      Test-FeedPackUrl $url $repo    true when a launcher can download it
      Split-FeedPacks $packs $repo   .Keep and .Drop, in feed order, each drop with .Why
      Get-FeedAssets $doc            every asset the feed names: What, Url, Sha, Bytes

      Move-FeedUrlsToSite $doc -Dev -OnSite { param($sha, $bytes) ... }
                                     rewrites each url the site holds to the site

  UPDATES COME FROM THE SITE (#897). Since then Publish-Update sends every new
  asset to /feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256> and writes that url, and nothing new is
  uploaded to Thornswood-Releases. The urls already on a feed move over with
  Move-FeedUrlsToSite, run by the next Ship on that channel or by
  Repair-Manifest.ps1 -MoveToSite, and only for an asset the site already
  answers for, so a feed never names a url that answers 404.

  THORNSWOOD-RELEASES GOES (#907). A publish takes updateRepo out of the feed,
  and a feed that names no updateRepo has no GitHub repository its packs may
  come from: Get-FeedRepo answers '' and every GitHub url is one a launcher
  cannot download, which is the truth once that repository is deleted. A feed
  that still names updateRepo (main until its next Ship) keeps its GitHub urls
  legal until then. Nothing here names Thornswood-Releases any more.
