  Publish-Pack.ps1

  Builds the optional packs listed in optional-packs.txt, sends them to the
  site, and adds them to version.json so every launcher offers them under
  Add-ons on its Diagnostics page.

      .\scripts\release\Publish-Pack.ps1
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Pack.ps1 -Only hd-textures
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Pack.ps1 -DryRun        build and check, upload nothing

  WHERE THE PACKS GO (#897). Updates come from thornswood.net since 28 Sep, so
  each zip is sent to /feed/assets/<sha256> on the site with
  Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 -Send (.part then rename) BEFORE version.json is
  touched, the feed names it there, and then the feed itself goes to the VPS
  store with Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1, which is what launchers read (#907).
  Nothing is uploaded to GitHub; the GitHub release path went with
  Thornswood-Releases.

  These are the files Package-Thornswood.ps1 deliberately left out of the
  installer. Both scripts read optional-packs.txt, so what comes out of one is
  exactly what goes into the other, and there is no way to ship an installer
  missing something nobody can download.

  THE ONE RULE, and it is checked rather than trusted: a pack may not contain a
  plugin. The server compares every enabled plugin by name, size and crc32, so
  one person with an extra esp is one person who cannot connect. Textures,
  meshes, sounds, weather and shaders are invisible to that check and are why
  this is safe at all. A pack with a plugin in it is refused and nothing is
  uploaded.

  THE OTHER RULE, checked the same way: every pack written into version.json
  has to be one a launcher can download, by Feed-Rules.ps1. The live feed is
  received from the VPS before the file is edited, so these packs land on top
  of whatever another machine has just published, and the send refuses a feed
  that changed up there in between rather than writing over it.
