  Publish-Server.ps1

  Run this ON YOUR LAPTOP. It packs the server, sends it to the VPS, installs it
  there and checks it came up. One command instead of six, and no RDP session.


  What it does, in order:
    0. refuses, naming each file, when anything it would send out of this
       repository has uncommitted changes (#1121)
    1. builds the payload zip from your local dist\server, refusing any
       server file (the binary, the JavaScript half, the rest the fork
       builds) that is not the build records\server-build.json names, and
       puts that record in the zip; the zip is read back and held the same
       way before it is sent (#1214)
    2. copies the zip across, with the server still running
    3. the installer unpacks it BESIDE the running server, gives it the
       running server's own settings with only the release's keys from the
       zip (ServerSettings.ps1, #1222), checks it there (the zip's hash, every
       plugin in the load order, gamemode.js parsing, every server file
       against its record, ServerBuild.ps1) and stops nothing if any of it
       fails
    4. only then stops the server, swaps the new folder in, registers the
       boot task and starts it; if it does not answer on its ports, the
       previous folder goes back and is started again (issue #446)
    5. once the installer has said INSTALL OK, records on the box what the
       server now runs (#459): the server build it installed goes to the
       store as an artifact with a name, read out of the payload
       (ServerArtifact.ps1), the gamemode artifact goes to the store, the
       box holds the installed gamemode.js and its build stamp to it, and the
       record goes into data\thornswood-deploy.json and the store's current
       record; then the engine commit the root's server-build.json names goes
       into the site's deployed-build.json (DeployedBuild.ps1), for the
       credits page (#2303). A record that cannot be written stops the run
       with exit 1, the server up.
    6. tries the resources port once, from here (#2975): the box has
       already had it answer, so this is the try a firewall rule shows up in

  The gamemode in the payload is game\gamemode.js as the commit holds it, the
  gamemode artifact (Artifact.ps1), and its build stamp (thornswood-build.json,
  BuildStamp.ps1) is made for the channel this publishes to, beside the
  artifact rather than in the build. A payload whose gamemode is not that
  artifact's, or whose stamp does not describe it for this channel (a
  -SkipBuild zip from an older commit), is refused before anything is sent.

  The world folder on the VPS is carried across reinstalls by the installer,
  so characters made on the server survive an update. -FreshWorld starts the
  server with none, and leaves the old one in the previous folder.

  The previous folder is kept beside the root, the newest two, and
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -PutBack
  puts the newest back the same checked way (-Channel dev for the dev server),
  and records the folder that came back by its own record (#459).

  THE TASK ALONE (#2491).
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -TaskOnly
  sends the installer and nothing to install, and the installer registers the
  server's scheduled task again with its own action and settings, stops the
  server and starts it through the new task (Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1
  -TaskOnly). No zip, no file in the server's folder but the log writer the
  task runs (server-log.js, #2349), no setting, no record and no news: it is how the box takes a change to the task itself, the
  priority it starts node at (#2491), without a release. If the server does
  not answer under the new task, the task it had goes back and is started.
  -Channel dev for the dev server. It drops whoever is on that server, so
  look at its online.json first.

  THE JOIN PASS SWITCH (#1804). The installer refuses, before anything is
  stopped, a server whose thornswoodRequirePass is neither true nor false,
  because the gamemode reads that as on (#1319), and says so. A first
  install always is such a server, since no build carries the switch (#1223).
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -RequirePass on
  sets it on the server in that publish (off lets a session act until its
  pass arrives); without it the running server keeps its own.

  THE BUILD IT PACKS (#459; the same defect #2309 found in
  Deploy-DevGamemode -LoadOrder). A publish packs a built server: the binary
  and the rest the fork builds, from an engine build's dist\server. -Dist
  names it. Left out, it is this checkout's own engine build (Where.ps1
  ServerDist), never another folder. This script runs only from a clean
  checkout at origin (#2118), which on the shipping machine is a fresh
  worktree with no engine build, so there -Dist is how the build is named:
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev -Dist <the build's dist\server>
  With no built server at -Dist it stops before anything is copied, built or
  sent, and says so. Whatever -Dist names, its server files are held to
  records\server-build.json before anything leaves (Export-ServerPayload and
  the zip read below), so a build of another engine commit is refused. The
  publish copies the commit's gamemode.js into that build and sets how many
  it holds in its server-settings.json, as it always has; the build is
  otherwise read, not changed.

  FROM THE STORE, WITH NO ENGINE BUILD HERE (-FromStore, #459). Since #2467
  every publish and every full Deploy-Server keeps the server build it sends
  in the box's store, C:\Thornswood-Deploys\server, by name. -FromStore puts
  the one records\server-build.json names onto the server from there, so a
  machine with no engine build can publish one:
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev -FromStore
  The payload carries no server build and no plugins: the commit's gamemode
  and its stamp for the channel, the record, how many the server holds
  (records\most-online.json) and any plugin of ours the running load order
  names, from game\content. Before anything is sent the box is asked which
  zip its store keeps for this record, and a publish with none stops there.
  The installer takes that zip's files into its stage, held to the record
  the way a payload's are, and the running server's plugins by its own
  order, and keeps its load order and start point (Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1
  says what it refuses). So it is the engine and the gamemode that move, never
  the order; a new order is Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 and a publish with -Dist.
  A build CI made and the store does not hold yet goes there first, held to
  the record here and again on the box:
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev -FromStore -ServerBuild <engine.yml's server-<...>.zip>
  A machine that takes CI's engine build (Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 -EngineBuild
  ci, #3047) has no built server to pack, only the files the record names
  and the zip they came in, so there a publish that names no -Dist does this
  by itself, with the zip from Where.ps1 EngineArtifact's artifact\server,
  fetching CI's build of the pin first when it is not there (#3262):
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev

  A LOAD ORDER THAT DROPS PLUGINS (#2320). The installer refuses, before
  anything is stopped, a payload whose load order leaves out a plugin the
  running server loads. On 5 Oct at 9:56 PM a dev publish of a fresh engine
  build carried the engine's own five base masters, because Deploy-Gamemode.ps1
  -Vortex had not yet written the collection's order into that build, and the
  dev server ran 48 plugins before and five after. When a plugin really is
  leaving the collection, name each one:
      .\scripts\release\Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev -DropPlugins 'Old Mod.esp'

  It also writes a line into the launcher's News page and pushes it.

  A server change ships nothing. The gamemode runs on the VPS, so there is no
  file for anybody to download and nothing for their launcher to notice, which
  meant every trade kit, every starting town and every fix to creation went out
  with nobody told, while a one line launcher tweak got a headline. Both show up
  in the same place now.

  A DEV PUBLISH PACKS THE DEV PORTS, AND ONLY INTO THE PAYLOAD.

  The build's server-settings.json is the LIVE one: port 7777, name
  Thornswood. Unpacked into the dev root unchanged it brings the dev server up
  on the live port, which is what happened the first time this channel was
  run. So Export-ServerPayload.ps1 -Channel dev writes port 7787, voice 7789
  and the name Thornswood Dev into its staged copy, and the zip carries them.

  It used to write them here, into the build's own file, and never put them
  back (#1114): the next live publish packed them and live came up on 7787
  under the dev name. The build is not written for a channel any more, a live
  export refuses settings that are not the live server's, and the zip is read
  back below before it is sent.

  Over a running server none of that reaches it any more (#1222): the
  installer keeps that server's own settings, its switches, npcSettings, ports
  and name, and takes from the zip only the load order, the start point and
  how many it holds (ServerSettings.ps1). The dev values here are for a first
  install into an empty dev root.

  DEV CARRIES MAIN'S ROSTER.

  Patrick, 21 September, on the dev server: "Dev has no playtetser list so I
  can't tp like I can on main", and then "keep the same list on dev as main as
  so I as Owner still have commands".

  The roles come out of private\door.json and private\allowed.json, which the
  door fetches and writes beside itself in the LIVE root. A dev root has never
  had them: nothing creates that folder on a fresh install, and the door on
  dev has no reason to have fetched yet. So every tier answered no to
  everybody on dev, including the owner, and /tp refused him on his own server.

  The live root's copy is taken as the truth and put into the dev root every
  dev publish, so the two lists cannot drift and a playtester added in Discord
  reaches dev the moment live has it. One direction only: dev never writes back
  over live.

  NOTHING IS READ OUT OF THOSE FILES HERE. They are copied on the VPS, from one
  folder to another, and only the count is printed. door.json is a config file
  and its contents are not this script's business.

  Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 now sets the folder aside and restores it, so
  after the first seeding this is keeping the two in step rather than repairing
  a wipe.

  ONLY THE DOOR, AND ASKING FOR THE DEV LIST (#964). This was
  Copy-Item -LiteralPath (Join-Path $live '*'), and -LiteralPath reads the *
  as a file name, so it never copied anything: the count it printed was what
  dev already held. Copying the whole folder would have been wrong anyway. It
  holds the dev server's own door.log, characters.json, property.json,
  farm-claims.json, take-limit.json, mod-settings.json and online-names.json,
  which belong to the dev world, and a door.json with the live address, which
  gives the dev door the live list. The dev door asks
  https://thornswood.net/dev, whose list is only the people the dev build is
  for (docs\SERVER.md, "The door"); on 28 Sep that took the dev list from 46
  to 28, which is right.

  So now: door.json is live's key and join pass key with the address ending
  in /dev, so a rotated key still reaches dev and the list stays the dev one.
  allowed.json is copied only when dev has none, so the Owner has commands
  on a fresh dev root until its door fetches its own. Nothing else is touched.

  NOTHING TO CARRY STOPS THE PUBLISH (#1336). A live root with no private
  folder, no door.json, one that does not read, or one without the address,
  the key or the join pass key used to be a line in green and a publish that
  went on to say it was done, with the dev door still on whatever key it had
  before the live one was rotated. Now the dev door is left as it was, the
  script says which of those it was and ends DOOR NOT CARRIED, and the
  publish stops there with exit 1. The dev server it installed is up; its
  door is what was not done. Only names are said, never a value.
