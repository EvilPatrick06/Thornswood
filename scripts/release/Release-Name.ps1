  Release-Name.ps1

  One name for each release, recorded in the feed and the store, and a git tag
  on the commit it was built from (#444).

      . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'Release-Name.ps1')

  WHY IT EXISTS. Measured on 28 September, a release was known by four things
  that nothing tied together: the launcher version (1.1.102.6, which since
  #921 stays the same across every Ship that does not change the launcher, so
  several releases share it), the pack id Publish-Update mints
  (20260928-2324-dev, also the name of its packs and, since #441, of its
  baseline record), the fork commit of the client runtime, and the source
  commit it was built from, which was written down nowhere at all. The only
  tags in the repository were the v<version> ones a person pushes by hand so
  CI builds a main launcher (release.yml), and a Ship that kept its launcher
  had no tag.

  So the release id is the one name. It is the only one every release has and
  no two share: a Ship that sends no pack still mints one, and a pack, its
  parts (<id>-2, <id>-3) and the baseline record all carry it already.
  Everything else is recorded against it:

    - the feed: "release" in version.json, { id, channel, launcherVersion,
      packs, baseline, commit, branch, uncommitted, tag }, written by
      Publish-Update (the release record block). No launcher reads it, and a
      launcher ignores a field it does not know.
    - the store: releases.txt beside launchers.txt on the VPS, one line per
      release, the id first (Feed-Store.ps1).
    - the repository: an annotated tag, release/main/<id> or release/dev/<id>,
      on the commit that release was built from, made and pushed by Ship only
      after the publisher has sent the feed (Add-ReleaseTag). Never v<...>, so
      it cannot start the launcher build in release.yml. In a cloud session,
      whose git cannot push a tag, GitHub makes it (Set-Ref.ps1, #3314).

      git tag -l 'release/dev/*'         every dev release
      git show release/main/<id>         what it shipped and where to find it

  Get-ReleaseDisagreements says whether a feed's names for its release agree
  with each other, and with "releases", the list Rollback-Feed.ps1 puts a
  channel back from (#442): the newest entry there is this release, by the same
  id, ending on its last pack. A rollback writes "release" for itself (#1058):
  its own id, the launcher the feed keeps, its one pack, its baseline, and no
  commit, so no tag. tests\test-release-name.ps1 drives the names;
  tests\test-feed-rollback.ps1 drives a rolled-back feed.

# ==== thornswood release id ====
# A NEW RELEASE ID, NEVER ONE THE FEED ALREADY USES (#1057). It was the minute,
# yyyyMMdd-HHmm, so two publishes inside one minute both got the same name: a
# launcher that took the first wrote that id into applied.txt and skipped the
# second as already applied, and the store, "releases" and the release tag named
# two releases the same. Now it is the second, yyyyMMdd-HHmmss (-dev on dev),
# and if the feed already names that id, or a part of it (<id>-2), it moves on
# a second at a time to the next free one.
#
# Every installed launcher still updates across it: a launcher compares pack
# ids only for equality (applied.txt) and a release record by its sha256, never
# by the shape of the id. Everything that reads the time out of an id takes
# its first 13 characters, yyyyMMdd-HHmm, and both shapes start that way.
# Publish-Update and Rollback-Feed both mint through this.
