  Check-Build.ps1

      .\scripts\release\Check-Build.ps1                  check the Thornswood build
      .\scripts\release\Check-Build.ps1 -Data "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data"
                                               check the Vortex build instead
      .\scripts\release\Check-Build.ps1 -All             list the ones that are fine too

  The server does not check plugin names. It checks size and crc32 of every
  plugin it names, so the wrong version of a mod is the same to it as not
  having the mod. "I installed it" and "I installed the right file" are
  different sentences and only one of them lets somebody connect.

  This reads the manifest the server publishes, walks a Data folder, and says
  which of the three a plugin is:

    missing       not there at all
    wrong file    there, but a different version than the server has
    fine          byte for byte what the server has

  It is the same comparison the client makes, run somewhere you can read the
  answer. Point it at the Vortex build to find out whether the collection
  actually reproduces Thornswood before anybody downloads it, and point it at
  somebody's install when they say they cannot get in.

  Reads only.
