  Check-CollectionRevisions.ps1

  Holds Nexus's newest published collection revision, the record and both
  feeds to each other, and keeps one issue on the board for the rebuild while
  they part (#4068).

      .\scripts\release\Check-CollectionRevisions.ps1            says, changes nothing
      .\scripts\release\Check-CollectionRevisions.ps1 -Issue     and opens or closes the issue

  WHY. Collection revision 5 was published on Nexus on 21 Oct, and on 27 Oct
  both feeds still named revision 2. Nothing compared them, and nothing told
  anybody the servers had to be rebuilt, so a launcher on revision 2 was let
  in and one on 5 was held out. Patrick, 27 Oct: "1. The launcher should
  always be on the newest revision 2. the new updates should be based on the
  newest revison 3. the launcher should refuse if not on the latest revison".
  A Ship already refuses while the record is not the newest published
  revision (CollectionRevision.ps1, Get-ShipNewestRevisionProblem); this is
  what notices a revision nobody has shipped yet, however it was published,
  in Vortex by hand or with New-NexusRevision.ps1 -Publish.

  WHAT IT READS. The newest published revision from Nexus
  (NexusPublished.ps1, the public read, no key), the revision
  records\collection-plugins.json names in this checkout, and the
  collectionRevision each feed names on the site (Feed-Store.ps1,
  Read-SiteFeed), which is the number every launcher holds Play to.

  WHAT IT SAYS. Exit 0 when all four agree, 1 when they do not, with a line
  for each that is behind, 2 when one of them could not be read: a check that
  cannot read its numbers has not checked anything, so it never answers 0.

  -Issue (.github/workflows/collection-revision.yml, every hour, with GH_TOKEN
  and REPO set). While they part, one open issue named for the newest
  revision says what is behind, so the rebuild is on the board for the Desk:
  the record first, then Thornswood-Last.esp on the new order, then dev,
  checked, then main. None is opened while one for that revision is open. Once
  all four say the same revision, every open one is closed by this, saying
  so. An unreadable number changes no issue. Exit 0 once the issue is as it
  should be, 2 as above.

  tests\test-4068-revision-check.ps1 runs it against stand-ins. Works on
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.
