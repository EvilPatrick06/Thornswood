  MergeRelease.ps1

  What .github/workflows/merge-release.yml works out between steps (#5179):
  the release's names, the newest Release before it, and which parts the
  merge changed. Dot-sourced; defines functions and nothing else. ASCII, and
  PowerShell 7. tests\test-5179-merge-release.ps1 drives every function.

      . ./scripts/release/MergeRelease.ps1
      New-MergeReleaseNames -Utc <DateTime> [-Taken <tags>]
          @{ Tag = 'build-20261101.7'; Velopack = '2026.1101.7' }
      Resolve-MergeReleaseSince -Commit <sha> -Subject <scriptblock> [-RepoDir .]
          where this history's notes start: the Release before's commit, or
          the same merge in this history when the history was rewritten
      Get-MergeReleasePrevious [-Repo owner/name]
          the newest published build-* Release and its manifest, or $null
      Get-MergeReleasePrint -Manifest <obj> -Part <name>
          one line that changes exactly when the part's content does
      Get-MergeReleaseChanged -Manifest <obj> [-Previous <obj>]
          the parts whose print differs from the Release before
      Test-MergeReleaseVelopack -LauncherVersion <a.b.c> -GameZipSha256 <hex>
                                [-Previous <obj>]
          whether this merge makes a Velopack package, and so builds the
          launcher with the release's Velopack version
      Find-MainPackage -Tag <tag> -Manifest <obj> [-Repo owner/name]
          the main package a promotion of <tag> puts out, and whether its
          Release main-<tag> is out already (promote-main.yml)
      Get-MainPackageProblem -Record <obj> -Have <name to sha256>
          '' when the files are exactly the record's main package
      Select-MainPackageArtifact -Artifacts <list> -Name main-<tag> -Commit <sha>
          the artifact merge-release.yml kept main's package in

  THE NAMES. The day and a number give both: the tag the agent applies,
  build-<yyyyMMdd>.<n>, and the Velopack version, which must be SemVer and
  must grow with every release: <yyyy>.<M*100+d>.<n> (no leading zero, so
  2 Jan is 102). n is one more than the highest the day's tags and Releases
  (drafts too) already use, so a name is never taken twice. It was the run
  number until 1 Nov, when renaming the workflow started its runs at 1 again
  and the first run asked for build-20261101.1, a tag the gamemode workflow
  had made that morning. Runs never overlap (one concurrency group), and a
  later day or a higher n is always the higher version.

  WHERE THE NOTES START. The commit of the Release before, when this history
  holds it. The history was rewritten on 1 Nov (#5231), so a Release from
  before then names a commit this history does not hold, and GitHub can
  compare nothing to it. That Release's merge is still here under another
  id with the same title, ending in its pull request's number, (#N), so the
  first-parent commit of this history whose title ends the same is where
  the notes start. No such commit, or more than one, and it stops.

  WHAT COUNTS AS A CHANGE. Every Release carries every part, so any of them
  can be put back by its tag; only a part whose content changed asks for a
  Deployment of its own, and a merge that changed none publishes nothing. A
  part's print is its files' names and sha256, sorted, with three kinds left
  out: the gamemode's stamp (thornswood-build.json names the commit, so it
  differs on every merge), the server zip (ServerArtifact.ps1 zips it on
  each run; its record, server-build.json, says which build it is) and the
  game files' list (game-files.json names the commit; game.zip is the same
  bytes for the same files, Build-GameFiles.ps1 says how). The
  velopack and main parts, dev's and main's Velopack packages, are made from
  the launcher and the game files, so neither is compared on its own.

  THE LAUNCHER'S PRINT is its source number (the manifest's launcherVersion,
  LauncherVersion.ps1), not its files (#4825). The exe carries the Velopack
  version it was packed as (-p:Version, Build-Launcher.ps1), so the same
  sources built for two packages are two different files; a launcher whose
  sources no merge touched is not a change, whatever its bytes.

  ONE NUMBER (#4825). A Velopack package is made when the launcher's sources
  or the game files changed, and the launcher in it is built for it, with
  the package's version, so the number the launcher says is the number
  Velopack installed. Otherwise no package is made and the launcher of the
  Release before is carried. Test-MergeReleaseVelopack makes that call from
  the same prints Get-MergeReleaseChanged compares, before the launcher is
  built, so the two cannot disagree.
