.SYNOPSIS
  The note and licence texts that go inside every download on the update feed that carries SkyMP files.

.DESCRIPTION
  Source-Notice.ps1

  Publish-Update.ps1 dot-sources this. It puts a note saying where the source
  is, and the GNU GPL and AGPL texts, inside the client runtime zip and inside
  every pack that carries a SkyMP file.

  WHY IT EXISTS. Issue #421. The six files in records\client-build.json are
  SkyMP, under the GNU GPL version 3 (MpClientPlugin.dll under the AGPL), and
  both licences ask that a copy of the licence and directions to the source go
  with the files. The installer does that (SOURCE CODE.txt and the texts,
  Package-Thornswood.ps1). The feed did not: on 28 September the dev feed's
  client-runtime-fde333f1.zip and the live feed's client-runtime-258fac47.zip
  held the six files and nothing else, and a pack that carried one of them
  said nothing either. Those are the downloads the launcher takes the files
  from, so they are what hands them on.

  THE LAUNCHER IGNORES WHAT THIS ADDS. ClientRuntime.cs takes out of the
  client runtime zip only the six paths the record names, and Updater.Install
  unpacks only game\ and profile\ entries of a pack (and reads delete.txt). So
  a note and two texts at the top of either zip travel with the download and
  change nothing a launcher does.

  THE LIBRARIES INSIDE THEM (#3099). The four native files of the six link
  the fork's vcpkg libraries statically, so each library's code is inside
  the file that uses it, and the MIT and BSD ones ask for their notice to go
  with every binary copy. records\client-licences.json, beside the client
  record, says which library is in which file (the fork's build reads each
  file's program database; New-ClientLicenceRecord.ps1 records it), and
  records\client-licences\<port>.txt is each one's text as vcpkg installed
  it. A download that carries one of those files carries, in licences\
  beside the note, the text of every library in the files it carries, and
  the note lists them. Version 2 of the note is the first that does.

  $SourceNoticeVersion goes into the feed's clientRuntime entry. A client
  runtime already on the feed without it (or with an older one) is published
  again even though its commit did not move, so the zip that carries the note
  replaces the one that did not.

  The folder and licence of each file are the same as Get-SourceNotice in
  Package-Thornswood.ps1 says in the installer's SOURCE CODE.txt, and
  tests\test-source-offer.ps1 holds the two to each other.

# Each SkyMP file the feed can carry, by its path in the game folder. Built:
# from the fork at the commit client-build.json names. Front: build.js, which
# every Ship builds from the fork's skymp5-front at the pin since #2931 and
# holds to front-build.json beside the client record. Not built: taken from
# upstream SkyMP, with no recorded commit (THIRD-PARTY.md, "From upstream
# SkyMP, not built here").

  $Kind 'runtime' is the client runtime zip: its note is README.txt and says
  what the download is. 'pack' is an update pack: its note is SOURCE CODE.txt,
  the name the installer gives the same note.

  Throws when a recorded file has no known source folder, so a new file in
  client-build.json stops the release until somebody says where it is from.

  build.js counts as built when $FrontRecord (front-build.json beside the
  client record, unless named) is there, and throws when that record is the
  build of another commit than the client record's, so the note never names
  one commit for files built from two. With no front record it is said as
  SkyMP's own, with no commit, as before #2931.
