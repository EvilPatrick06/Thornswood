  LauncherVersion.ps1

  Works out the launcher's number from git, so it is never committed.

  #5179, the plan's part 7, "the version comes from the build". Dot-sourced
  by Ship.ps1, Build-Launcher.ps1, BuildStamp.ps1, Check-ShipReady.ps1,
  Nexus.ps1 and release.yml; defines functions and nothing else. ASCII, and
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 as well as 7.

  WHY. The number was a line in launcher\app\Updater.cs, so every launcher
  change needed a second pull request that moved it (Bump-Version.ps1):
  four in the last hundred merges on 31 Oct 2026 (1.2.12, 1.2.14, 1.2.15,
  1.2.16), each one more build, more review and more wait before a main
  release could carry the change. #5192 was one: the engine pin moved, so
  1.2.15 "cannot carry it (Ship-Main stopped on the number)".

  THE RULE. The launcher's number is the time, in UTC, of the newest commit
  on the checkout's first-parent history that changed anything the launcher
  is built from, written year.monthday.hourminute: 2026.1101.1745 for 5:45
  PM UTC on 1 Nov 2026. What the launcher is built from is the list
  Ship.ps1's Get-LauncherInputHash fingerprints (every file under launcher\
  but the Markdown, records\client-build.json, records\ui-gone.json,
  records\generated.json and scripts\release\Build-Launcher.ps1), the same
  list here as $script:LauncherInputPathspec, so the number moves exactly
  when the fingerprint does on a committed tree.
    - The same sources always give the same number, from any commit after
      them, so a main Ship from a later commit that changed nothing in the
      launcher finds the launcher dev tried under the number it expects
      (#5156), and one whose launcher is already out keeps it (#921).
    - A later change always gives a higher number, so every launcher is
      offered it: Updater.IsNewer compares the parts as numbers, and each
      part fits the 0 to 65534 a Windows file version allows.
    - Two changes inside one minute: the later one takes the minute after
      the earlier one's number, so no two launchers ever share a number. That
      is worked out from the history itself, the same on every machine.
  A dev number is this number with a fourth part, as before (Ship.ps1).

  Needs the history: a shallow checkout cannot say when the launcher last
  changed, so it stops and says so rather than guessing.
