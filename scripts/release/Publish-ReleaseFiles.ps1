  Publish-ReleaseFiles.ps1

  Puts every file one release names on a GitHub Release of this repository,
  on the release's own tag, so downloads and updates come from Releases
  (#3686, Patrick's decision of 26 Oct for going public).

      pwsh scripts/release/Publish-ReleaseFiles.ps1 -Tag release/main/20261026-170000
      pwsh scripts/release/Publish-ReleaseFiles.ps1 -Tag release/dev/20261026-160000-dev

  Run by .github/workflows/release-files.yml with the run's own token in
  GH_TOKEN; it needs nothing else and no secret.

  WHAT A LAUNCHER SEES. Nothing new: every launcher keeps asking
  thornswood.net/feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>, and the site answers that with a
  redirect to the Release's copy once GitHub shows it publicly (site/server.js,
  "release copies"). So each file goes up named by its sha256, the name the
  site looks for, and GitHub's own digest of it has to be that sha256.

  WHICH FILES. The tag's message names them (Release-Name.ps1,
  Get-ReleaseFileShas): the record, the launcher, the client runtime, the
  notes, and the signed manifest with its catalog. The record lists every
  other file of the release, by bytes and sha256. A tag made before #3686
  names none; then the channel's live feed is read, and only when it still
  names this very release. Each file is fetched from the site, checked
  against its sha256 (and its bytes, where the record gives them), and only
  then uploaded. A main release also carries the installer the Downloads page
  offers, as Thornswood-Setup.exe, checked against the sha256 the site lists.

  WHAT IT REFUSES.
    - A private repository: a Release asset there answers 404 to a launcher,
      and a Release made now would go public with the repository, with
      whatever it holds. Nothing is uploaded until the repository is public,
      which Patrick does only after #3721's blockers, the files other people
      own among them, are cleared. It says so and exits 0.
    - A tag that is not release/main/<id> or release/dev/<id>.
    - A published Release that lacks a file: a published Release is never
      changed (a new build is a new release). It says which file and exits 1.
  A Release is made as a draft, filled, checked file by file against GitHub's
  digests, and only then published: a dev release as a prerelease, a main
  one as the latest. A draft a stopped run left is filled from where it
  stopped. Run again on a release that is already published and complete, it
  says so and changes nothing.

  EXITS. 0 published, already there, or private. 1 refused or failed, with why.
  tests\test-3686-release-files.ps1 drives it against a stand-in GitHub and site.
