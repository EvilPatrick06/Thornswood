  Get-ScratchDir.ps1

      & (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'Get-ScratchDir.ps1') 'Thornswood-launcher-Thornswood'

  Says where a short-lived build scratch folder goes, so Ship and
  Install-Thornswood take their launcher build (and the CI setup stub)
  from one place instead of each calling [IO.Path]::GetTempPath().

  WHY. Patrick, 28 September: every build scratch root and temp file goes
  under one temps folder, never %TEMP%. Until this helper, Ship.ps1 and
  Install-Thornswood.ps1 both staged the launcher under GetTempPath(), so two
  Ships from two worktrees for the same Root shared one %TEMP% folder and
  could pick up each other's exe (issue #1272).

  WHERE. The repository's own temp folder, ignored by git (Patrick, 20 Oct,
  #2900: "temp files and folders and work trees should move into the repo
  folder and just be gitignored"). From a worktree it is the main checkout's
  temp, not one inside the worktree, so every checkout on the machine shares
  one temps folder as before and a path stays as short as it can. A broken
  worktree link stops with a sentence rather than guess another folder. Until #2900
  it was C:\ThornswoodTemps&Worktrees\temp on One.

  OVERRIDE. THORNSWOOD_SCRATCH_ROOT, when set, replaces the temps folder.
  tests\test-ship-dry-run.ps1 points it at its own sandbox so a dry run never
  writes beside the real temps tree. Outside a git checkout (a copy of the
  scripts with no repository round them), falls back to
  [IO.Path]::GetTempPath() so they still run.

  Read only for the path itself: creates nothing and prints nothing but the
  one path. Callers that write use -LiteralPath, so a folder with [ or & in
  its name still works.

.PARAMETER Task
  Folder name under the scratch root, for example
  Thornswood-launcher-Thornswood or Thornswood-setup-Thornswood.
