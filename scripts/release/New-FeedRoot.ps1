.SYNOPSIS
  Stages the folder a release from the feed is built from: every file the
  channel's last release left installed, from the site, by its sha256.

.DESCRIPTION
  Patrick's A on #2754 (20 Oct): dev and main Ships run without One, and carry
  the files that change only with the collection from the last release record.
  Measured on dev 20261020-111032-dev: 173 of its 288 files, 57.3 MB, are
  BodySlide outfits, Pandora behaviours, the six body meshes and old fork
  copies, which no checkout can make and which only a collection Ship on One
  changes. The other 115 the build makes from this checkout.

  So this puts the whole record into <Root>\Game, each file fetched from
  /feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256> and held to that sha256, and Ship -FromFeed then
  builds over it exactly as a Ship on One builds over its game folder: the
  front, Go.ps1's files, the plugins, the client. A file the build no longer
  makes stays as it would in One's folder, and Ship-Rules decides whether it
  ships, the same way. Nothing of the collection's is in the folder, so the
  publish carries the last release's plugin list (Publish-Update -FromFeed).

  The six client files are then held to records\client-build.json rather
  than to the last release (#2983): a file the release carried at another
  build is taken from the site by the sha256 the record names, from this
  channel's assets or else the other channel's, so main can carry the client
  a dev Ship already put on the site without an engine build here. A client no
  Ship has carried yet is on neither feed: it is taken from CI's engine build
  of the pin instead (the fork's own build, which Get-EngineArtifact.ps1
  fetches and holds to the records, #3047), so the dev Ship that first carries
  a new engine pin runs without an engine build here too.

  It also writes <Root>\config.json from the feed's own server, voice and site
  fields, so the publish writes them back as they are: only a Ship from One
  moves a server.

  WHAT IT REFUSES
    - a feed that names no record, or a record whose files are not all on the
      site (no :record:files): a collection Ship from One sends them first;
    - any file that does not hash to the name the record gives it;
    - a recorded client file that is on neither feed's assets nor in CI's
      engine build of the pin with the bytes the record names.
  A file already in the folder with the right bytes is not fetched again, and
  anything in Game the record does not name is removed first, so the folder
  is the record and nothing older.

  Talks to the site (https), and to GitHub through Get-EngineArtifact.ps1 only
  when the recorded client is on neither feed; never to the VPS over ssh.
  Writes nothing outside -Root but the engine build Get-EngineArtifact.ps1
  keeps in this machine's own data.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release\New-FeedRoot.ps1 -Channel dev
  Stages dev's last release into this machine's feed-root\dev folder.

# engine build of the pin holds exactly those bytes (#3047), so a file on
# neither feed is taken from there, and refused only when that cannot give it.
