.SYNOPSIS
  Puts the client runtime built from the fork into the game folder, and
  refuses any file that is not the recorded build.

.DESCRIPTION
  The six files in records\client-build.json are the SkyMP client Thornswood
  ships: the bundle, MpClientPlugin.dll, both SkyrimPlatform DLLs, the CEF host
  and TESModPlatform.pex. New-ClientBuildRecord.ps1 writes that record after a
  rebuild; this copies the files it names from the fork's build output into
  the game folder, from where the next Ship packs them and the next
  Package-Thornswood puts them in the installer.

  Every file is hashed before it is copied and compared against the record.
  A mismatch stops the whole run with both hashes printed, because a runtime
  that is not the recorded one is either stale, or somebody else's, and until
  20 September it was the second: another server's launcher had written its
  own client into the Steam copy and the folder build copied it across.

  When the game folder already holds all six as recorded, nothing is copied
  and the build is not read, so a checkout with no engine\skymp build still
  answers 0 for a game folder that is right (issue #946).

  CI'S BUILD, issue #3047. A rebuild is never the same bytes, so only the
  build a record was made from matches it, and since #459 that is CI's. On a
  machine that takes CI's build (Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 -EngineBuild ci) the
  default -Dist is Where.ps1 EngineArtifact's client folder, named for the
  pin. When the game folder needs the client and that folder is not there
  yet, Get-EngineArtifact.ps1 fetches engine.yml's artifact into it first,
  held to the records, so a Ship or Go after a pin move needs no engine build.
  -Check fetches nothing.

  Nothing here talks to the VPS, starts anything, or touches the Steam copy.

.PARAMETER Check
  Compare and report only. Nothing is copied.

.PARAMETER Game
  The game folder. Defaults to Thornswood's own.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release\Sync-Client.ps1 -Check
  Says which of the six are already in place, which differ, and whether the
  build matches the record.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release\Sync-Client.ps1
  Copies the recorded build in. Go.ps1 runs this.
