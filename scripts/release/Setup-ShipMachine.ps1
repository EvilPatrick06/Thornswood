.SYNOPSIS
  Checks and prepares a Windows machine to Ship dev, and says what is left
  for a person to do.

.DESCRIPTION
  WHY IT EXISTS. Issue #458, "If One dies, the release process does not
  survive". Since #907 the feed and the Ship baseline live on the VPS and the
  release webhooks are read from there too, so most of what a Ship needs is
  already off Patrick's machine (One). What was still only on One, measured on
  29 September: the signing setup (records\signing\signing.json, which names a metadata
  file outside the repository, Microsoft's signing client, and the az sign in
  behind it) and the client runtime build the record names. No copy of the
  recorded client sat anywhere on One but the dev game folder; the site's feed
  had the only other one.

  This does the parts a script can do and names the rest:

    1. The tools a Ship calls: git, gh signed in, PowerShell 7, node, ssh,
       the .NET Framework 4 compiler, signtool from the Windows SDK, az, and
       the .NET 8 runtime Microsoft's signing client runs on.
    2. Microsoft's signing client in records\signing\client. When it is not
       there it is fetched from nuget.org at the version pinned below and
       refused unless its sha256 is the pinned one.
    3. records\signing\signing.json. When there is none it is written from
       records\signing\signing.template.json, which holds paths and "enabled": true, no key. An
       existing one is never changed: it is read, and anything wrong with it
       is said.
    4. The az sign in. Each person who ships signs in as themselves, with an
       account of their own in the signing tenant that holds the Certificate
       Profile Signer role on the ThornswoodRelease profile, which Patrick
       makes once (Developer-Guide.md "Your own signing sign in"; Patrick,
       4 Oct, #1740; until then only his account signed, #1121). A device
       code sign in is refused by the tenant (AADSTS530035). It asks the signing service, with this
       machine's sign in, what identity the profile carries, and checks it is
       the one the launcher pins (launcher\app\Signature.cs). A sign in that
       cannot reach the profile says so here instead of at the end of a Ship.
    5. The client runtime records\client-build.json names. When neither the
       game folder nor the build folder holds it, the zip of that exact
       commit is fetched from the site's feed (the clientRuntime entry in
       /feed-dev/version.json or /feed/version.json), checked against the
       feed's sha256 and size, unpacked, and each of the six files checked
       against the record's sha256 before anything is put in the build
       folder. Not on either feed: -Rebuild builds the fork instead.
    6. Then Check-ShipReady.ps1 for the channel, which asks every other
       question Ship asks (the dev build, its game folder, the Vortex profile,
       the VPS and the feed store) and gives the verdict.

  WHICH FOLDER A RELEASE IS BUILT FROM (#1692). -Root records the folder
  this machine builds the channel's release from, in the file Where.ps1
  ShipRoots names (this machine's own data, beside its copies of the feeds),
  and Ship, Check-ShipReady, this and Build-Generated read it back through
  Where.ps1 ShipRoot and ShipRootDev. Needed where that is not the launcher
  install (main) or the install with -DevBuild on the end (dev): on a machine
  whose Vortex deploys into C:\Thornswood-DevBuild, the dev release folder is
  another one (docs\COLLECTION-REVISION-2.md step 8). A folder Vortex
  deploys into is never recorded.

  WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It writes no secret anywhere, never turns signing off
  or writes "enabled": false, never edits an existing records\signing\signing.json,
  never ships, publishes or deploys, and does not sign anything. The only
  files it writes are the signing client under records\signing\client, a new
  records\signing\signing.json, the six client files in the build folder
  (Where.ps1 ClientDist), and its downloads under out\ship-machine, all
  ignored by git, and with -Root the file Where.ps1 ShipRoots names, outside
  the repository.

  Any developer may run a main Ship from a machine that can sign
  (Developer-Guide.md): -Channel main checks that machine.

.PARAMETER Channel
  dev (the default) or main: which channel Check-ShipReady asks about, and
  which game folder the client is checked in (the channel's release folder,
  Where.ps1 ShipRoot or ShipRootDev, and its Game).

.PARAMETER Root
  The folder this machine builds the channel's release from, recorded for
  Ship, Check-ShipReady and Build-Generated to read (see WHICH FOLDER). With
  -Check it is only used, not recorded.

.PARAMETER Check
  Report only. Nothing is fetched or written; each step says what it would do.

.PARAMETER Rebuild
  When the recorded client is on neither feed, build the fork with
  Build-Engine.ps1 (an hour or more the first time) instead of stopping with
  the command.

.PARAMETER NoVps
  Passed to Check-ShipReady.ps1, which then skips the two questions that ask
  the VPS over ssh.

.PARAMETER NoPause
  Exits without waiting for Enter.

.PARAMETER Site
  Where the feeds are read from. https://thornswood.net unless a harness says
  otherwise.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release\Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 -Check
  Says what this machine has and what it would fetch or write, and changes
  nothing.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release\Setup-ShipMachine.ps1
  Prepares what it can for a dev Ship, then runs Check-ShipReady -Channel dev.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\release\Setup-ShipMachine.ps1 -Channel dev -Root C:\Users\evilp\Downloads\Thornswood-Repo\local\release-devbuild
  The same, and records that a dev release on this machine is built from
  local\release-devbuild in the repository, One's dev release folder since
  5 October. Give the whole path: it is recorded for every clone and
  worktree. After moving a release folder, run
  .\scripts\mods\Build-Generated.ps1 -Channel dev once, because the
  generated files record the game folder they were built for.
