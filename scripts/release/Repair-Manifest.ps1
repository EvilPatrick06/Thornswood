  Repair-Manifest.ps1

  Takes packs with no download url back out of version.json and sends the fix.
  Since 24 September it takes out packs held anywhere but the repository
  launchers read the feed from as well.

  How one gets in there: publishing uploads each pack as a release asset and
  writes the returned url into version.json. When an upload fails, the pack is
  still written, with an empty url. Every launcher then tries to download from
  nothing, fails with "The path is not of a legal form", and because a pack it
  cannot apply is a pack the server is expecting, Play stays switched off. It
  locks out everybody at once, including the person who published it.

  A pack removed here is not lost work: the next publish rebuilds from the
  current build, so whatever was in it ships again in the next one.

  The other kind is a pack whose url is a release asset anywhere but the
  repository launchers read the feed from (Feed-Rules.ps1 has the rule and the
  measurement). On 24 September that was 164 of the 227 packs on the live feed,
  20260910-2345 to 20260914-1917, all in the private source repository, which
  has no releases left, so nothing can download them with or without a token.
  Taking them out loses nothing a launcher could have had. The installer is
  built from a game they were applied to, which is why Package-Thornswood.ps1
  seeds applied.txt with their ids.

  It works on the feed launchers read: since #907 it receives version.json
  from the VPS store into this machine's working folder for the channel
  (scripts\release\Feed-Store.ps1), and sends the repaired one back, which is
  the moment the site serves it. The send refuses, replacing nothing, if the
  feed or the baseline changed up there after it was received. Until #907 it
  worked on the Thornswood-Releases clone and pushed; until 24 September on
  version.json in the source repository, which no launcher read.
  -RepoDir <folder> works on the version.json in that folder instead and
  receives nothing; the tests use it with -NoPush.

      .\Repair-Manifest.ps1            show what is broken and fix it
      .\Repair-Manifest.ps1 -DryRun    show it and change nothing
      .\Repair-Manifest.ps1 -Channel dev -DryRun    the same for the dev feed

  MOVING THE URLS TO THE SITE (#897). With -MoveToSite it takes nothing out:
  every url on the feed that still points at GitHub, and whose bytes the site
  already answers for at /feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>, is rewritten to that
  address, and the feed is sent like any other repair. A url the site does
  not answer for stays where it is. It is how the main feed moves without
  waiting for a main Ship.

      .\Repair-Manifest.ps1 -MoveToSite -DryRun     what would move
      .\Repair-Manifest.ps1 -MoveToSite             move it and send it
