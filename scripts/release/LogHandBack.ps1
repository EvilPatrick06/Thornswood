  LogHandBack.ps1

  A file handed back from a workflow run in its job's log rather than as an
  artifact. Dot-sourced by .github\workflows\engine.yml, which prints the
  records it makes this way, and scripts\release\Get-EngineRecords.ps1, which
  reads them back (#3399). tests\test-3399-engine-records.ps1.

  WHY. This repository's artifact storage is private, metered over the month,
  and was used up on 25 Oct (#3410): engine.yml's upload was refused, and
  stayed refused after every stored artifact that could go went, because
  what is used up is time stored, which a delete does not give back. A run's
  log takes no room in that storage, GitHub keeps it 90 days, and
  gh api repos/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job>/logs hands it to any machine with gh,
  a cloud thread's too. board-read.yml hands board.json back the same way
  (#3192, Read-Board.ps1).

  THE SHAPE. One begin line, "<mark> begin <bytes> <sha256>", the file's
  length and sha256; then the file gzipped and in base64, 4000 characters a
  line, each line "<mark> <base64>"; then "<mark> end". A log line may start
  with GitHub's timestamp. The mark is made by the step from two halves
  ('ENGINE' + '-RECORDS'), so the step's own text, which the log shows
  before it runs, never holds it.

  Keep it Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh alike.
