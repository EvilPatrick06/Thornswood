  Ship-OnBox.ps1

  The deploy gate's Ship verbs (#2841): a Ship from the feed run on the box
  itself, from main as the gate reads it, so a cloud session ships with no key
  to the box (Patrick, 30 Oct 2026: "we arent doing this on One").

      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Ship-Dev -Title "Market stalls take your own prices" -Detail "Claim a stall in a town market and sell at your prices"'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Ship-Main -Build <main''s full commit> -Title "..." -Detail "..."'

  Ship-Dev is Ship.ps1 -Channel dev -FromFeed. Ship-Main is Ship.ps1
  -FromFeed, the main release, and the gate runs it only when main is at the
  commit -Build names (the build Patrick gave his word for). On either,
  -ModsOnly keeps the feed's launcher. Without it, a launcher that changed is
  built and signed on GitHub from main's commit, the way Ship.ps1 does it
  from the feed, so a new launcher goes to dev before main like everything
  else. Until 31 Oct a dev Ship from the gate always kept dev's launcher, so
  a launcher change could only reach dev from One, and launcher 1.2.12 would
  have gone to main untried.

  WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM ONE. Nothing in Ship.ps1. Its box steps
  (Publish-Update, Sync-Client, Publish-Installer, the feed store,
  announced.json) reach the box the way they do from One, as Administrator
  over ssh, here over loopback with the gate's own key. Two things only this
  script does:

    1. The notes. A gate line is one line of plain text, so the release note
       comes as -Title and up to three -Detail lines, which become the title
       and the "- " lines Ship.ps1 asks for.
    2. GitHub. A Ship from the feed signs its manifest in the engine fork
       (Sign-OnGitHub.ps1) and, with a new launcher, has release.yml build
       it, both through gh. The box admin App mints a token for this run
       alone (scripts\vps\admin\ShipAccess.ps1 runs ship-access.js;
       Patrick's pick of 30 Oct: Actions write on the fork and Thornswood,
       Contents read on Thornswood), which goes to gh through GH_TOKEN and
       nowhere else, and GitHub ends after an hour. gh is the one
       Install-Gate.ps1 pinned beside the gate (C:\Thornswood-Gate\tools\gh).

  The release tag (release/<channel>/<id>) is pushed with git, and the gate's
  checkout reads GitHub with a read-only key, so Ship prints the tag as a
  line it could not push; the Desk puts it on with Set-Ref.ps1, as a cloud
  Ship's always has (#3314).

# MAIN'S HISTORY AND THE RELEASE TAGS (#5133). The gate's checkout is one
# commit of main with no tags (GateBroker.ps1, Update-Checkout), and Ship
# reads history in two places: the dev feed's DEV marks (Dev-News.ps1) prove
# a note's commit is in main's release through git and the release/dev tags,
# and with neither every note keeps its mark (31 Oct 2026: after main
# 20261031-144725 all 16 dev notes stayed DEV, the journal crash fix main
# carried among them); and Close-ShippedIssues.ps1 stops on a shallow
# checkout. So the Ship deepens the checkout to the whole of main and its
# tags first. The gate's next fetch makes it one commit deep again, so every
# Ship asks. origin/main is put back where the gate checked it, so a merge
# landing meanwhile is not taken: the Ship is of the commit the gate read.
