  Note-Rules.ps1

  What release notes may say. Ship.ps1 dot-sources this and refuses notes that
  break it, before anything is built. tests\test-note-rules.ps1 drives the same
  function, so the rule and its test cannot disagree.

  TWO COPIES, ONE ANSWER (plan rev 64). The same rules are in C# in
  tools\ReleaseNotes (thornswood-notes), which the "Release note" check runs
  on every pull request. This copy stays while Ship.ps1, Rollback-Feed.ps1,
  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1, Collect-ReleaseNotes.ps1 and EnginePin.ps1 read it,
  some of them on the box, which has no .NET SDK, and goes when they move to
  C# or retire. tests\fixtures\note-rules-cases.json holds the answer for
  every case, and tests\test-note-rules-cases.ps1 and tools\ReleaseNotes.Tests
  hold each copy to it, so a rule changed here is changed there too.

  WHY IT EXISTS. Release notes are read by customers in three places: the
  launcher's News tab, the site's News page and Discord. Developer-Guide.md says
  plain words, never "player", no em dashes, and never pull request numbers or
  branch names in them. Ship checked only that there was a title and a detail
  line (25 September), so on 26 and 27 September these went out anyway:

    "This is what players actually got from demoting 1.1.92.1 through 1.1.95.4"
    "Place no longer throws walked is not defined (fireWalked / PR #239)"
    "Server load order is kept after Fix PutInServerOrder"
    "Autoplay uses WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS instead of
     EnvironmentOptions that faulted CreateAsync on One"
    "Bar covers whole run; every stop says why.#617 #618"

  and "Launcher 1.1.101" twice in one list.

  WHAT IT REFUSES, in the title, the body and every detail line:
    - the word player or players
    - an em dash
    - an issue or pull request number (#123), "PR", "pull request"
    - a code file name (.cs .ps1 .js .dll .json .exe .xaml .py and the like);
      a mod's .esp name is allowed, people see those in Vortex, and so is a
      .swf, which SkyUI's own error box names
    - our own shop words: demoting, worktree, cherry-pick, squash, CI
    - an environment variable (WORDS_LIKE_THIS)
    - a code identifier: camelCase, or three or more joined capitalised words
      (PutInServerOrder, EnvironmentOptions); a short list of ordinary names
      (SkyUI, SkyMP, GitHub, YouTube, WebView) is allowed
    - a version number in the title, and a four-part number (1.1.92.1)
      anywhere, which the News page check reads as a server address
    - the same line twice
  Each problem comes back as one line saying what and where, so the person
  shipping can rewrite it rather than guess.

  THE RELEASE NOTE IN A PULL REQUEST (#5179).

  A release's note was written by whoever shipped it, from merged pull request
  titles, after the fact. Since #5179 each pull request carries its own note,
  written by the person who made the change, and the build check reads it
  while the pull request is open (thornswood-notes pr, run by
  .github\workflows\pr-body.yml). Collect-ReleaseNotes.ps1 joins the notes of
  every pull request merged since the last release into the release's note, so
  nobody writes one at release time and nothing in it is new to the rules.

  In the pull request body, outside any <!-- comment -->:

      Release note: The forge shows the price before you pay
      - The forge window lists each metal a piece takes and how much.

  A headline of three words or more, then at least one "- " detail line
  directly under it: the same shape a release's note has, so a release that
  carries one change is that change's note as written. A change nobody would
  notice in the game, the launcher, the site or Discord (scripts, tests, docs
  for the team, the board) says:

      Release note: none
#>

# The note a pull request body carries. Returns Found (a Release note line is
# there), None (it says none), Headline, Details (the "- " lines under it) and
# Text (headline and details as one note), and Count, the number of Release
# note lines, so a body with two can be refused rather than half read.
