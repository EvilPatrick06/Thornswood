  Rollback-Feed.ps1

  Puts a channel's feed back to an earlier release, so every launcher on that
  channel moves its game files back to what that release installed, with no
  hand editing of version.json (#442).

      .\scripts\release\Rollback-Feed.ps1 -Channel dev -List          what it can go back to
      .\scripts\release\Rollback-Feed.ps1 -Channel dev -Back 1        the release before this one
      .\scripts\release\Rollback-Feed.ps1 -Channel dev -To 20260929-1200-dev
      .\scripts\release\Rollback-Feed.ps1 -Channel dev -Back 1 -DryRun   build it, send nothing

  WHY IT EXISTS. The feed is a chain of deltas: a launcher applies every pack
  whose id is not in its applied.txt, in order, and never takes one back. So
  the only way back from a bad release was to ship another one by hand that
  put the old files back, which is what 1.1.77 did for 1.1.76 on 21 September.
  Since #441 every release publishes the record of what it left installed
  (every file of ours by size and sha256), and since this change the feed keeps
  the last thirty of those records as "releases". The difference between two
  records is exactly what a rollback has to send.

  WHAT IT DOES. It reads the record of the release the feed is on now and the
  record of the one asked for, and builds ONE ordinary pack out of the
  difference: every file whose bytes differ goes in at the older release's
  bytes, every file the later releases added goes in delete.txt, and the plugin
  list goes in as that release shipped it. The pack goes on the end of the feed
  like any other, so every launcher already installed takes it the way it
  takes every update: nothing in the launcher changes, and a launcher that is
  several releases behind applies them and then this, and lands on the same
  files. Putting the channel forward again is the same command pointed at the
  later release. The feed's "release" is rewritten for this rollback (#1058):
  its own id, the launcher the feed keeps, its one pack, its baseline, and no
  commit, so no tag. The store's releases.txt then gets a line for it.

  ONCE THE PACKS ARE GONE (#1050): when the feed's minLauncher is at or above
  the first launcher that syncs to the record (Test-FeedPacksGone,
  Release-Baseline.ps1), the feed carries no packs and the rollback is the
  record alone: no pack goes on the feed, the plugin list is the target
  record's own :golden: entries, and a record whose files cannot all be had
  is refused with nothing sent. The list of releases it goes back to is the
  store's releases.json beside the feed since then, not "releases" in it.

  Each file is taken first from the site's copy beside the release record
  (/feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>, #1050), then from the packs already on the
  site, found by size and sha256, and checked again when it is read. A file
  only the installer ever carried is restored the same way, so a rollback past
  the release that first changed it needs no -FilesFrom (#1051). When that
  asset is missing, the rollback stops and names it, and -FilesFrom points at
  a folder holding the right bytes, which are checked the same way.

  WHAT STAYS. The launcher, its version and minLauncher: a launcher never moves
  to a lower number, signed launchers refuse an update not signed by us, and
  the site refuses a join pass above the feed's launcherVersion, so taking the
  number down would lock out everybody already on it. The six client runtime
  files stay with the launcher, because the launcher carries the record of
  which client belongs beside it and puts back any other. The server is not
  part of the feed: if the release being undone changed the gamemode or the
  plugins the server loads, put the server back too.

  The pack and the record go to the site before version.json names them, and
  the feed and the store's baseline go back through Feed-Store.ps1 in one send,
  which replaces nothing if another Ship or feed edit went out meanwhile.

  -SiteDir <folder> stands in for C:\Thornswood-Docs and nothing connects
  anywhere; tests\test-feed-rollback.ps1 drives it that way.
