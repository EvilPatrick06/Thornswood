  Whether a note tells a channel something it has already been told (#3320).

  WHY IT EXISTS. Patrick, 22 Oct 2026, 10:24 AM: "the news keeps adding
  duplicate lines from previous launcher and server build updates and not
  only what is new". Measured that morning:

    - The dev updates channel was told "Immersive Armors recipes ask for the
      right things" and its two lines twice: at 9:45 AM by
      Deploy-DevGamemode -Note, and at 9:50 AM by the dev Ship that carried
      the same change to the launcher, with the same note. The run notes in
      ops\claude-queue had asked for exactly that (one $note for both).
    - The dev feed's 7:08 AM "A new launcher" said again two lines of the
      6:32 AM "Clearer launcher messages and a visible axe" (the Ready card,
      the Open Steam button), because the launcher those lines describe went
      out in the second release and its notes were written from the first.

  Nothing compared a note with what the channel had already said, so a
  repeat went out whenever a person wrote one. So the posts a channel has
  had are the record: the notes its feed carries (the launcher's News tab
  and the site), and every post Publish-Discord.ps1 has made to its Discord
  channel, gamemode deploys included (announced.json in the channel's VPS
  store, "posts-main" and "posts-dev"). A Ship or a dev gamemode deploy
  whose title or one of whose "- " lines is already there stops before
  anything is built or sent, and says where it was said.

  Lines the publisher writes itself are facts about each release (a launcher
  number, the download size, the load order warning) and are never compared.
