  Front.ps1

      . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'Front.ps1')

  What Build-Front.ps1 and Go.ps1 share about the front build, the page
  skymp5-front's webpack makes for Data\Platform\UI: the record of it, the
  zip it travels in, and the check that a zip is the recorded build.

  WHY. Until 20 October the front was local\thornswood-front.zip, built on
  One from nobody knew which commit and checked by nothing, and Go.ps1
  unpacked whatever was there. Measured that day (#1317): the zip predated
  the fork's #40, so every release still shipped four commercial faces, DIN
  Pro and Futura PT, as hashed .ttf files under Data\Platform\UI, a month
  after the fork had taken them out. Patrick's A on #2754 builds the front
  from the pinned fork instead, in the cloud or anywhere, so the build is
  recorded like the client's (records\front-build.json) and a zip that is not
  that build is refused.

  Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7, on Windows and Linux.
