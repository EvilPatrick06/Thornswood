  Feed-Store.ps1

  Where each channel's feed, its release baseline and their history are kept,
  and the only code that reads or writes them there (#907).

      . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'Feed-Store.ps1')

  WHY IT EXISTS. Until 28 September the feed (version.json) and the baseline
  Ship diffs against (published.json) lived in two git clones of
  EvilPatrick06/Thornswood-Releases beside the repository, pulled, committed
  and pushed by every script that edits the feed. Since #897 every download
  comes from thornswood.net, so that repository held nothing a launcher needs,
  and Patrick asked for it to go: "I just want the repo deleted in general if
  we won't be using it anymore". So the store moved to the VPS, beside the feed
  the site already serves:

      C:\Thornswood-Docs\feed\version\<8 digits>.json
                                                every feed sent, one new file each,
                                                never replaced; the newest is the
                                                live feed (served, #2727)
      C:\Thornswood-Docs\feed\published.json    the live baseline (not served)
      C:\Thornswood-Docs\feed\launchers.txt     every launcher version this
                                                channel has published (not served)
      C:\Thornswood-Docs\feed\releases.txt      every release the feed has named,
                                                by its id, with what else it is
                                                known by (#444, not served)
      C:\Thornswood-Docs\feed\releases.json     the record of each of the last
                                                thirty releases, which a rollback
                                                goes back to (#442); in the feed
                                                as "releases" until #1050 (not
                                                served). Received and sent by
                                                name, like published.json
      C:\Thornswood-Docs\feed\history\          each other file as it was before it
                                                was replaced, <utc stamp>-<name>
                                                (not served)

  and the same under feed-dev for the dev channel. site\server.js answers only
  /feed[-dev]/version.json and /feed[-dev]/assets/<64 hex>, so nothing else in
  those folders can be fetched (tests\test-feed-store.ps1 asks a copy of it).

  ON THIS MACHINE each channel has a working folder, not a git repository:
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Thornswood\feed\main and ...\feed\dev (Get-FeedStoreDir). A
  script receives the files into it, edits them there, and sends them back.
  read.json in that folder records the sha256 of each file as it was received,
  and backup\ keeps the last twenty copies of each file received, so this
  machine always has the last few feeds and baselines it saw.

  TWO PUBLISHERS AT ONCE. A send checks, on the VPS and in the same step that
  replaces the file, that every file it names still has the sha256 it had when
  this machine received it. If another Ship or feed edit has gone out since,
  nothing is replaced and the send throws, the way git refused a push that was
  behind. The file goes up as <name>.part first and is renamed over the old one
  only once it is whole, and the old one is copied into history\ first.

      Get-FeedStoreDir main|dev          this machine's working folder
      Receive-FeedStore main|dev -Dir    fetch the files, record what was read
      Send-FeedStore main|dev -Dir -Files version.json[, published.json]
                                         send them back, refusing if moved
      Get-FeedStoreThere main|dev        the sha256 of each file up there now
      Get-FeedStoreLaunchers main|dev    launchers.txt, one version a line
      Get-FeedStoreReleases main|dev     releases.txt, one release a line
      Read-SiteFeed main|dev             the feed as the public reads it
      Write-FeedVersionFile -Path -Doc   write version.json as every writer
                                         must: compact, no byte order mark
                                         (Feed-Json.ps1, dot-sourced here)
      Remove-FeedStoreAssets main|dev -Shas -Expect
                                         delete assets no feed names any more,
                                         refusing if either feed moved (#1152)

  -SiteDir <folder>, or $env:THORNSWOOD_TEST_SITE_DIR, stands in for
  C:\Thornswood-Docs on this machine: every read, send and rename happens in
  that folder, by the same script the VPS runs, and nothing connects anywhere.
  The tests use it.

# ------------------------------------------------------------ the one rename
# A file into the place of another in one rename. Until it the file is the
# old one, after it the new one. Not File.Replace (#2591): ReplaceFile moves
# the old file aside first and then the new one in, so a send stopped
# between the two left the feed file missing, and the site answered 404 for
# it until the next send (tests\test-2591-whole-records.ps1 kills a swap in
# a loop and finds the file whole every time).
#
# The rename keeps POSIX semantics (#2727): SetFileInformationByHandle with
# FileRenameInfoEx and FILE_RENAME_FLAG_POSIX_SEMANTICS. The plain rename,
# MoveFileEx with MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING, which this was from #2591 to
# #2727, is refused with "Access is denied" while ANY handle is open on the
# file it replaces, even one opened with share-delete, even a stat. The site
# (site\server.js) stats version.json for every launcher's 304 and every
# feed watch tick and reads it for every 200, so a Ship could stop with NOT
# SHIPPED because a launcher asked for the feed at that moment. Measured 18
# Oct on One, 2000 swaps beside a node loop doing server.js's statSync and
# readFileSync: MoveFileEx refused 1616 of them, this rename none. A reader
# that opened the file with share-delete keeps reading the old bytes. A
# handle opened WITHOUT share-delete still refuses it, with "being used by
# another process"; every reader in this file and the site's node open with
# share-delete. What no rename gives is a name that is always there: for a
# moment inside every replace, POSIX or not, the old name is gone and the
# new one not yet in (measured 19 Oct, #2727, on the box and on One). So
# the file the site serves, version.json, is never replaced at all: each
# one is a new file (the feed's own generations, below). Needs NTFS on
# Windows 10 1709 or Windows Server 2019 or later: the VPS is Windows Server
# 2022, and the working folder is under LOCALAPPDATA on the system drive.
# Windows PowerShell 5.1, which runs this on the VPS, has no such call in
# .NET, so it is declared. Its own type, not Generated.ps1's RecordSwap, so
# neither can load the other's rename first in one session.
