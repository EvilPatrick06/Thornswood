  ForkEngineBuild.ps1

  Finds the public fork's own build of an engine commit, and puts it where a
  build of that commit on this machine would be, for engine.yml to record.
  Dot-sourced by .github\workflows\engine.yml, scripts\release\EngineArtifact.ps1
  (a Ship machine takes the same build, #3399) and tests\test-459-fork-build.ps1.

  WHY, issue #459. Patrick's B of 16 Oct: the fork, EvilPatrick06/skymp, is
  public, so GitHub builds it at no cost, and since fork #79 every push to
  thornswood/engine-changes builds the engine there and keeps what Thornswood
  records as one artifact, thornswood-engine-<commit> (the fork's
  .github\workflows\thornswood-pr-windows.yml says what is in it). engine.yml
  takes that build and records it, and compiles nothing (#3014, #3399): a
  Ship machine takes the same build from the fork (EngineArtifact.ps1), so a
  build compiled anywhere else would be bytes no Ship machine could take.
  Recording is light work, so the hour of compiling stays off the box the
  game servers run on.

  WHICH BUILD. Only a push to thornswood/engine-changes in the fork itself,
  of exactly that commit, that finished green, and whose artifact is still
  kept (90 days):
    - none at all, or a green one that kept no artifact (it ran before fork
      #79, or its 90 days are over): there is no fork build, and engine.yml
      stops saying so;
    - one still running: engine.yml stops and says to start it again once
      that has finished;
    - one that ended red (a compile error or a unit test): engine.yml stops
      and names it. The fork is public, so its runner is never refused for
      billing, and a red there is a red engine.
  A lookup that fails (the network, the token) stops the run with the error:
  it is not "the fork has none".

  WHAT IS HELD before anything is recorded. The artifact's own sha256 (the
  digest GitHub keeps for it), then fork-build.json, which the fork's build
  wrote: its commit, run, repository, event and branch must be the ones
  asked for, every file it names must be in the artifact with its sha256 and
  size, and nothing else may be. Then each file goes to its path under the
  fork's build folder, where Build-Engine.ps1 and Build-Server.ps1 would have
  put it, and gets back the time fork-build.json gives: a zip keeps a time
  with no zone, so on a machine that is not on UTC it would read hours off,
  and the record's builtUtc is the binary's time. New-ServerBuildRecord.ps1
  and New-ClientBuildRecord.ps1 then hold every file to the fork's source as
  for any build, with -BuiltBy naming the fork's run.

  Keep it Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh alike. It reads nothing over the
  network itself: engine.yml hands it the reader, and the harness a stand-in.
