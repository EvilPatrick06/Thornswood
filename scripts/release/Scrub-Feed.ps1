  Scrub-Feed.ps1

  Takes Bethesda's files and one machine's own files out of what a channel's
  feed has already published: every pack that carries one is rebuilt without
  it, every release record that names one is written again without it, the feed
  and the store's baseline are sent through Feed-Store.ps1 like any other feed
  edit, and the old bytes are then deleted from the site once no feed names
  them (#1152, #1227, #1229, #1239).

      .\scripts\release\Scrub-Feed.ps1 -Channel dev -DryRun   what it would do
      .\scripts\release\Scrub-Feed.ps1 -Channel dev           dev first, then check it
      .\scripts\release\Scrub-Feed.ps1 -Channel main          then main

  WHY IT EXISTS. Ship-Rules keeps Bethesda's files out of every new pack,
  record and installer (Test-ShipBethesda), but what went out before those
  rules is still on the site. Measured 29 September over HTTPS: main packs
  20260926-1327, 20260926-1603 and 20260926-2209 carry SkyrimSE.exe.bak-1160-for-369
  (a copy of Skyrim) and CreationKit.exe with its settings; 20260927-0059 and
  20260927-0250 carry 1,897 more of the Creation Kit's files (its dialogue
  views, Tools, Papyrus Compiler, lex, Data\Scripts.zip); 20260915-2018, 2104
  and 2144 each carry the script extender's 62 script sources under
  Data\Scripts\Source. The dev feed lists all of them too. The five dev release
  records name Data\Scripts\Source\IED.psc, which went up loose, and the two
  oldest of them name the whole Creation Kit. Patrick, 29 September: take them
  off the site and rebuild what needs rebuilding so no install breaks.

  ONE MACHINE'S FILES (#1239), the same day, the same way. Ship-Rules asks
  Test-ShipOneMachine for them: runtime state and tokens, logs, backups, face
  exports, Vortex's records, window layouts, settings saved from a mod's menu.
  Measured over HTTPS: 35 packs carried them (nine expired voice join tokens,
  two expired join passes, Vortex's 6 MB deployment record, one machine's key
  binds, crash and display settings, face exports, files a Claude session left
  in the game folder, backups), and every dev record named the join pass or the
  mod menu settings of the machine that ships. Patrick: scrub them from the
  site the same way as the Bethesda files, and stop them ever being packed
  again.

  OTHER PEOPLE'S LOOSE FILES (#1178, #1253), the same way again, as files:
  RaceMenu's menus, other mods' scripts, BodySlide builds, leftovers of mods
  nothing loads, another server's haybale and boss list (Test-ShipNotOurs).
  Patrick, 29 September: "we can scrub already published copies". Unlike the
  two rules above, a delete line or a gone entry naming one stays: an earlier
  release took that file out of installs on purpose, and it keeps doing so. And
  what Ship-Rules holds for the collection stays until a run made on a machine
  whose Vortex has the revision that carries it.

  WHAT CHANGES, AND WHAT A LAUNCHER SEES.
    - A pack keeps its id and every other entry, byte for byte and in the same
      order, with the same file times; only the entries that go (and any line of
      its delete.txt that names one, except what $ShipDeleteAlways deletes on
      purpose) go. Its sha256 and size change, so the feed's entry gets the new
      sha256 and the url that names it.
      A launcher matches packs by id in applied.txt (Updater.Pending), so an
      install that already applied the pack does not fetch it again, and one
      that replays every pack from nothing gets the pack without them.
    - A release record keeps every other key; the entries naming files that go,
      as files and as gone (but not what $ShipDeleteAlways deletes), go. Records are named by their sha256, so
      the new one goes up beside the old one and the feed's "baseline" and
      "releases" name it, with its new entry count. "release" names only ids
      and does not change. The store's published.json is the baseline record's
      own bytes, so it is replaced with the new record in the same send; a
      published.json from before the feed named a baseline (main) is written
      again without them.
      A launcher that synced to the old record sees a record it has not synced
      to, checks every file against it, and writes the new one down. Bethesda's
      files and one machine's files dropped from a record are not listed as
      gone, on purpose: Ship-Rules never lists them as removed, because a
      delete reaches Steam copies where they are the person's own; the
      launcher takes Bethesda tools out of its own game folder itself
      (OwnGame.BethesdaTool). Other authors' loose files (#1178, #1261) that a
      record drops become :gone: with the sha256 the record had for them, so
      the launcher deletes only a copy whose bytes still match what we
      shipped.
    - Rollback-Feed reads the new records and finds each file in the rebuilt
      packs by its size and sha256, which have not changed.
    - Nothing here is an exe or the installer, so nothing is signed: a pack
      and a record are checked by their sha256 in the feed, and the launcher's
      own update (launcherUrl, launcherSha256) is not touched.

  THE ORDER. Dev first, then check it, then main. The dev feed lists the main
  packs by their /feed/assets urls, so the dev run builds and sends the new
  main packs as well and points the dev feed at them; the main run makes the
  same bytes (it takes the ones the dev feed already names when they are this
  pack without the files that go, and otherwise rebuilds, which gives the same
  bytes on the same machine) and points the main feed at them.

  DELETING. Every sha256 a run replaces is written to a ledger on this machine
  (scrub-ledger.json in -WorkDir) BEFORE anything is sent (#1244): the first
  dev run on 29 September stopped between sending the feed and writing the
  ledger, and the next run, finding nothing to change, did not know what to
  delete. At the end of every run each one that
  neither feed names any more, directly or through a record either feed names,
  is deleted from both /feed/assets and /feed-dev/assets, through
  Feed-Store.ps1, which deletes nothing if either feed moved since it was read
  and keeps anything either feed or either baseline still spells out. So after
  the dev run the old records and IED.psc go, and the old main packs stay
  until the main run points the main feed away from them.

  -SiteDir <folder> stands in for C:\Thornswood-Docs and nothing connects
  anywhere; tests\test-scrub-feed.ps1 drives it that way.
