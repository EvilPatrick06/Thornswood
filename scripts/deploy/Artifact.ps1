  Artifact.ps1

  What a deploy sends, built from a commit rather than copied off a working
  tree, and what the box keeps to say which commit each part runs. Issue #459.
  Dot-sourced by Deploy-Docs.ps1 (site), Install-Voice.ps1 (voice),
  Install-Bot.ps1 (bot), Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1, Deploy-Server.ps1 and
  Publish-Server.ps1 (gamemode). Publish-Server records through
  Set-ThornswoodServerRecord and Restore-ThornswoodServerRecord, near the end.

  THE ARTIFACT. New-ThornswoodArtifact reads the named paths out of the
  repository's HEAD commit (git's own bytes, so line endings and file dates on
  this machine do not come into it) and writes them into one zip:

      <component>-<commit, 12>-<sha256 of the zip, 16>.zip
      e.g. site-655846b6a1c2-3f09c2d1e8a7b654.zip

  The zip is stored (no compression), its entries in ordinal order, every date
  2000-01-01, written by the few lines of C# below rather than by .NET's
  ZipArchive, whose headers and deflate output differ between Windows
  PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7. So the same commit gives the same bytes on
  any machine, and the name alone says which commit it is. Beside it,
  <same name>.json is the record: component, commit, sha256, size, and every
  file with its own size and sha256. The record has no clock in it either.

  A DEPLOY SENDS A COMMIT OR NOTHING. A file with uncommitted changes, staged
  or not, deleted, or untracked, under the named paths or among the other
  repository files a deploy sends (-AlsoSends), refuses the deploy before it
  talks to the box, naming every such file (Assert-ThornswoodCommitted).
  There is no switch past it: commit the change, or put it back, and run the
  deploy again. Patrick, 29 Sep, issue #1121. Until then (#1090) such a
  deploy went through and its record said "edited". Ignored files are never
  sent and do not count.

  SITE AND VOICE, BEFORE ANYTHING IS SENT. Deploy-Docs.ps1 and
  Install-Voice.ps1 call Assert-ThornswoodSourceIntegrity on the artifact
  they just built. It checks the zip's hash and every file in the expanded
  tree against the commit's own blobs. If any of that differs, it throws
  and those scripts do not send. Issue #1335.

  The zip is expanded next to itself, laid out like the repository, into a
  folder <same name>.<32 hex> that is never renamed, and <same name>.folder
  names it (#2888). The deploy scripts send from that folder instead of from
  the working tree, so what goes up is exactly what the zip holds.

  TWO RUNS AT ONE COMMIT (#2459, #2742). Two runs from one checkout at one
  commit (a deploy and a Ship, two dev deploys) build the same artifact under
  the same names. Each run writes its zip, its record and its .folder file
  under names of its own, then gives each its real name in one step that
  either takes the name or finds it taken (Set-ThornswoodArtifactName), with no
  look first and never replacing what is there. Only files are named that way,
  never a folder: Windows refuses to rename a folder while anything has a file
  in it open, and a virus scanner opens the files an unpack has just closed
  (#2888). A run that finds the name taken holds what is there to what it
  built (the zip by its sha256, the record field by field, the folder the
  .folder file names by every file's size), uses it when it is the same and
  says so, and refuses, changing nothing, when it is not.

  ON THE BOX, C:\Thornswood-Deploys:
    <component>\<name>.zip and <name>.json   every artifact sent, kept
                                              (Send-ThornswoodArtifact); server\
                                              holds each server build a full
                                              deploy or a publish sent
                                              (ServerArtifact.ps1)
    current\<part>.json                       what each part runs now, one per
                                              folder a part runs from, e.g.
                                              thornswood-server-dev.json
    history.log                               one line per deploy
  and a copy of the part's record beside what it runs, as
  thornswood-deploy.json (Set-ThornswoodArtifactCurrent). Those are read over
  HTTP: the site's /api/deploys lists every part for staff signed into the
  hub (#1359), the voice service's /health carries its own, and a game
  server serves its own from its data folder, so
  http://<box>:3000/thornswood-deploy.json for live and :7788 for dev.

  Nothing here stops, starts or swaps anything. Building needs git; sending
  needs ssh and scp and the person's key on the box, nothing else, so any
  machine that can reach the box can do it.

<#
  A FULL SERVER PUBLISH RECORDS THE SAME WAY (#459). Publish-Server.ps1 does
  not swap files inside the root the way Deploy-Server.ps1 does: the installer
  swaps the whole folder and keeps the old one beside it as
  <root>.prev-<stamp>, and it does not carry data\thornswood-deploy.json from
  one folder to the next, because that file describes the folder it is in.
  Until 11 Oct a full publish wrote no record at all, so the new folder went
  on naming the gamemode the old one ran (measured 30 Sep: e445101a, with
  32dea10d installed).

  Once the installer has said INSTALL OK, which is the new server answering on
  both its ports, and the artifact is in the store (Send-ThornswoodArtifact),
  Set-ThornswoodServerRecord asks the box to hold what the root now runs to
  that artifact: gamemode.js must be the artifact's own bytes, and the root's
  thornswood-build.json must describe that gamemode.js. Either one wrong, and
  nothing is recorded and the box says SERVER NOT RECORDED and why. Otherwise
  the record goes beside it (data\, where the server serves it) and into
  current\<part>.json, with a line in history.log, the same record
  Set-ThornswoodArtifactCurrent writes. It names the commit the gamemode came
  from; the engine's own commit is in the root's server-build.json, which
  DeployedBuild.ps1 reads for the site, so the two stay apart.

  After a put-back, Restore-ThornswoodServerRecord: the folder that came back
  has its own record in data\. It becomes current only when the store's record
  of the artifact it names lists the gamemode.js that came back with it. A
  folder with no record, or one whose record does not describe its gamemode.js
  (a folder installed before 11 Oct holds the record the folder before it
  had), is recorded as an older copy with no commit, as Restore-SwapRecord
  does for a put-back inside the root.
