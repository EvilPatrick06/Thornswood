  CollectionStore.ps1

  The collection's plugins on the box, for the revision the repository
  records, so a server can move to a new collection revision with nothing of
  One's (#4069).

  WHY. A game server loads the collection's plugins and nothing else of it.
  Until 31 Oct 2026 every deploy that sent them read them from One's Vortex
  game (-Data), so a server could take a new revision only from One. On that
  day the dev move to revision 6 stopped at its first publish with
  "cheddars_mashups.esl is not on this machine": the box had none of
  revision 5's or 6's new plugins, and no cloud step could put them there.
  Patrick's rule of 30 Oct is that releases run from the cloud and do not
  rely on One.

  WHERE THEY COME FROM. Nexus, through Nexus-Run (scripts\release\Nexus-Run.ps1):
  Install-NexusRevision -KeepPlugins lays the revision out on GitHub's runner
  with the Nexus key of the "desk" environment and keeps the copy of each
  plugin the layout places. The output is sealed on the runner to a key the
  box makes for that run alone, so the authors' files reach the box and
  nobody else, the same way they reach a session. The box starts the run and
  reads its answer with the box admin App's token for that run alone
  (ShipAccess.ps1: Actions write and Contents read on Thornswood).

  WHAT IS HELD. Every plugin the layout keeps has to be in
  records\collection-plugins.json at the same size and sha256, and the
  layout has to be the revision and collection the record names; anything
  else stops here and nothing goes into the store. A plugin the record names
  that the layout does not have (the game's own masters, Skyrim.esm and the
  rest, which the servers already load) is not the store's to hold, and
  nor is ours (Thornswood-Content.esp), which every deploy sends from the
  repository.

  AND WHAT SKYUI'S MENU CHECK READS. A release that moves the revision runs
  Check-SkyUIMenus.js against the revision's own files, which are on no
  machine, so the store keeps those too, in menus\ at each file's path in the
  game folder: SkyUI's script, the loose menus and the archives that hold
  either (Install-NexusRevision -KeepPlugins says which). Each is held to the
  sha256 the layout's files.txt names for its path before it goes in.

  WHERE IT GOES. C:\Thornswood-Deploys\collection\<slug>-<revision>, beside
  the store of server builds, written into a folder of its own first and
  moved into place whole, with store.json saying what is there. A store that
  is already whole for the record is used as it is, read again by sha256.

  Dot-sourced. Defines variables and functions and nothing else.
  tests\test-4069-collection-store.ps1 holds it with no box and no Nexus.
