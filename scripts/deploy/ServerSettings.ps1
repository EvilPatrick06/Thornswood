  ServerSettings.ps1

  Which settings a game server install takes from the release, and which it
  keeps from the server it replaces. Dot-sourced by Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1
  (on the box, from beside it: Publish-Server.ps1 sends the two together),
  Export-ServerPayload.ps1 and Deploy-Server.ps1. Deploy-Server also sends
  this file's text to the box in front of $settingsCarryBlock, so the carry
  is done there, against the file the running server has.

  WHY, issue #1222. Dev rollout 6, 29 September: Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel
  dev unpacked the build's server-settings.json over the dev server's own,
  with only the port, the voice port and the name made the dev ones. The dev
  server came up with thornswoodServer, thornswoodLoadOrderRefuse and
  thornswoodRequirePass empty and an npcSettings "default" key, which refuses
  every NPC, until Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 put them back. A live publish would
  have done the same to live, and so would a Deploy-Server.ps1 from a build
  whose settings are not the live server's (#1221).

  THE RULE. The settings a server runs are its own. An install starts from the
  file the running server has, and takes from the release only the keys the
  release is meant to change:

    a server install, Publish-Server.ps1 and Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1
    ($ThornswoodInstallKeys):
      loadOrder             the payload carries the plugins it names, and
                            every form id resolves against their order
      startPoints           a form id, whose file index is that order's
      thornswoodMostOnline  how many it holds, and the engine's seats over it
      maxPlayers            for staff, from records\most-online.json, which
                            Publish-Server holds to the commit and every deploy
                            writes the same (#481)

    Deploy-Server.ps1, the second half of the live pair
    ($ThornswoodGamemodeKeys): those, and what Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 writes for
    the live server on purpose, because Deploy-Gamemode then Deploy-Server is
    the one route that changes them on live: offlineMode, the live voice
    port, thornswoodServer main, and the NPC, gear, reloot and damage settings.

  THE JOIN PASS AND THE WRITTEN ROLE LISTS ARE NEVER TAKEN FROM A BUILD
  (#1223). thornswoodRequirePass, thornswoodDevs and thornswoodPlaytesters
  used to be release keys, written into a machine's build by
  Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 -RequirePass, -Devs and -Playtesters and kept in that
  build for good, so every later Deploy-Server from that machine sent them
  again: a second machine given -RequirePass off a week before would turn the
  live hold off with nothing said but the key's name. Now they are the
  server's own, like every switch, and change on live only when the person
  deploying asks in that run: Deploy-Server.ps1 -RequirePass on|off, -Devs,
  -Playtesters, set on the box by the carry ($Asked, below), the way
  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -RequirePass sets dev's. A server install takes the
  join pass the same way (#1804): Publish-Server.ps1 -RequirePass on|off,
  which Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 sets over the running server's, or into
  a first install's.

  Everything else stays as the running server has it: every other thornswood
  switch (the load order refusal, the join pass), npcSettings, the role lists,
  the ports, the name, dataDir, and anything the release does not name. A key
  the release has and the server does not is not added, and a release key the
  release does not have stays as the server has it. On dev,
  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 is what changes the switches; on live, Deploy-Gamemode
  then Deploy-Server, and Deploy-Server's own switches for the join pass and
  the role lists. The two boxes keep their own, on their own folders.

  A GAMEMODE-ONLY DEPLOY TAKES NO KEY AT ALL (#1089). Deploy-Server.ps1
  -GamemodeOnly sends no settings and has no build to take any from, so the
  stage gets the running server's own file, copied unchanged on the box
  ($settingsKeepBlock), and the swap lets no key move. It takes none of
  -RequirePass, -Devs and -Playtesters; those are a full deploy.

  Values are compared as compact JSON, so an array and an object compare by
  what they hold. Nothing here prints a value: server-settings.json is the
  server's config, and only key names are said.

  Keep it ASCII and Windows PowerShell 5.1: it runs on the box.

  The running server's settings with the release's keys put in. Returns
  Settings (the object to write), Changed (release keys that move), Kept
  (keys the release had differently, or had and the server does not, left as
  the server has them), Absent (release keys the release does not carry at
  all, left as the server has them), and Said, the lines to print.

  Absent used to go unsaid (#1336). A live deploy whose build carried no
  thornswoodRequirePass, or no role lists, kept the running server's and the
  run said only which keys moved, so it read the same as one that had set
  them. Now each is named. Names only, never a value.

  $Asked (#1223) is what the person deploying asked for in this run, as an
  object of key and value: Deploy-Server.ps1 -RequirePass, -Devs and
  -Playtesters. Each is put in over the running server's, whatever the
  release has, and comes back as Set (the asked keys that move) and in Said.
  A key asked for is never taken from the release and never called kept or
  absent, even when $Keys names it (Deploy-Server's read-back list does).

  A LOAD ORDER THAT DROPS WHAT THE SERVER LOADS (#2320). On 5 Oct at 9:56 PM
  Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev sent a payload built from a fresh engine
  build (3a32e961) whose server-settings.json still held the engine's own
  order, the five base masters, before Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 -Vortex had written
  the collection's into it. The installer took loadOrder from the release, as
  a release key, and checked only that every plugin it named was there, which
  five masters are. The dev server ran 48 plugins before and started on five:
  nine Riekling characters were set aside with "bad raceId", every NPC change
  from Populated Cities failed to parse, and the NPC runtime refused to start,
  until the 10:01 PM start had the order again.

  A plugin the running server loads and the new order does not is every form
  of it gone from the world, and every full plugin after it one index lower,
  which is the shape ServerOrder.ps1 already says out loud for the light
  order. So an install or a deploy that takes loadOrder over a running
  server's refuses one that leaves out any plugin the running order has,
  unless the person running it names each one that may go, in that run:
  Publish-Server.ps1, Deploy-Server.ps1 and Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -Dist all
  take -DropPlugins. Names are compared by file name, any case, whatever the
  folder in front. A plugin added, or the same plugins in another order, is
  not this check's.

  Returns Dropped (every plugin the running order has and the next does not),
  Unasked (those -DropPlugins did not name), Said (the lines to print) and
  Problem ('' when nothing unasked goes, otherwise the refusal). A running
  server with no loadOrder, or a next one with none, drops nothing here: the
  first has nothing to keep, and the second keeps the running one.
