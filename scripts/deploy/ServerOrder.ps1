  ServerOrder.ps1

  The server's load order once the engine loads light plugins (#1715), and
  the full index a form id is computed from. Dot-sourced by
  Deploy-Gamemode.ps1, Publish-Server.ps1 and Check-Chargen.ps1, and by
  tests\test-light-order.ps1, which holds it to the measured lists.

  WHY. A light plugin's forms have ids 0xFE000000 | (light index << 12) |
  local id, the light index being the plugin's place among the light plugins
  the game loads. Until the engine loaded them the server left every light
  plugin out and the light order was whatever each machine's Vortex and LOOT
  gave it. Measured on 5 Oct over the 133 session logs on the VPS since
  24 Sep: ten different light orders, KhisartinBeards.esp anywhere from light
  index 0x1E to 0x29, 0x29 in the main sessions of 5 Oct and 0x27 in the
  last dev one. The server stores what the client sends, so a beard stored
  on dev on 25 Sep under light index 0x20 (0xFE020827) names another plugin
  under the dev order of 5 Oct. docs\LIGHT-ORDER-DRIFT.md has the
  measurement, and scripts\oneoff\Move-LightFormIds.ps1 moves such ids once.

  THE RULE IS THE ONE THE FULL ORDER ALREADY HAS. The world keys stored forms
  on their index, so the order the server already runs is kept: its full
  plugins in their order and its light plugins in theirs, a plugin that is
  new on the end of its own kind, and one that is gone said out loud, because
  every plugin of its kind after it moves up one. The first time light
  plugins are listed there is no light order to keep, and it is taken from
  the plugin list the way the game takes it: Skyrim.ccc's entries that are in
  Data straight after the five masters (_ResourcePack.esl is light index 0),
  then the list with master flagged plugins first.

  THE SETTING. loadOrder lists every plugin the game loads, full and light,
  in the game's own order, so a light patch overrides the same records on
  the server as in the game. Lightness is not written down: the engine reads
  it from each plugin's header (0x200, or an .esl name), the same rule as
  Test-LoadOrderLight. A full plugin's index is its place among the full
  ones, so code that turns a plugin into a form id counts full plugins only
  (Get-ThornswoodFullIndex), never the position in the list.

  ONLY WITH AN ENGINE THAT LOADS THEM. An engine that does not gives every
  listed plugin a full index, and a light plugin in its list would move every
  full plugin after it. records\server-build.json says which engine a build
  is (lightPlugins, written by New-ServerBuildRecord.ps1 from the fork's
  source), and Deploy-Gamemode lists light plugins only when it says so.

  Keep it ASCII and Windows PowerShell 5.1.

  The plugin list in the order Thornswood-Last.esp was built against (#2468).

    $Wanted    the plugin list's enabled names
    $Recorded  game\data\last-plugin.json's loadOrder

  Get-ThornswoodServerOrder keeps each kind's order but takes the places
  full and light plugins hold among each other from the list it is given,
  and that is the order every machine loads: the launcher puts the named
  plugins into the server's whole order (LoadOrder.ReorderWhole). Which of
  two plugins wins a record depends on those places, and the last plugin
  copies the winners of one order. On One on 17 Oct Vortex sorted its list
  again at 6:32 PM: the same full order and the same light order, 26 places
  between them changed, and the live deploy took them from the list, so
  the main Ship refused the plugin ("at position 10 this release loads
  RaceCompatibility.esm and the plugin was built with
  AHZmoreHUDInventory.esl"). The list given here is in the recorded order,
  so the places come from the plugin's own record and never from a
  machine's sort.

  Returns Wanted (the recorded names the list enables, in the recorded
  order, then any it enables that the record does not name) and NotRecorded
  (those last ones, which mean the plugin was built for another list).
