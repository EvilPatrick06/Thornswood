  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1

  Sends game\gamemode.js to the dev server on the VPS and restarts only that
  server. The dev server is a copy of the live install on its own ports
  (vps-dev-instance.ps1: C:\Thornswood-Server-Dev, UDP/TCP 7787, resources
  7788, task 'Thornswood Dev Server').

  Deploy-Server.ps1 is for the live server and must not be pointed at the dev
  root. It would do two wrong things there: send server-settings.json
  rewritten from the local build, which carries the live port and name and
  would start the dev server on 7777 next to the live one, and stop every node
  process whose command line contains skymp5-server, which is the live server
  too. This script sends gamemode.js alone and stops only the process that is
  listening on the dev port.

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1        syntax check, copy, point at 7789,
                                   restart, tail the log

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -LoadOrder
                                   the same, and first send every plugin the
                                   dev server's own load order names that it
                                   does not hold at these bytes: our content
                                   plugin from this checkout, the rest from
                                   the collection (see WHERE THE ORDER COMES
                                   FROM below)

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -LoadOrder -Dist <built server folder>
                                   the same, with the load order a server
                                   build names, written over the dev one

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -LoadOrderRefuse on
                                   the same, and end a session whose plugins
                                   are not the server's (#402); off only warns

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -RequirePass on
                                   the same, and hold a session until its
                                   join pass arrives (#410); off lets it act
                                   meanwhile. A session with no pass is ended
                                   at three minutes either way (#937). A dev
                                   server whose settings hold neither true
                                   nor false is refused until this says which
                                   (#1319)

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -Npcs off
                                   the same, with no NPCs kept alive by the
                                   server; -Npcs on puts them back (#385)

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -Minutes 3
                                   a longer warning for the people on it
    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -Mode restart
                                   tells them to log out, and puts out
                                   whoever is still on when it runs out
    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -Now  no warning and no wait, which is what this
                                   did for everybody until 24 September

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -PutBack
                                   the files the last run replaced go back in,
                                   after the same warning, checked the same way

    .\Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -Note "The door answers on the first knock
    - The door no longer needs a second try before it opens."

  -Note is required on every deploy except -PutBack. It is the same shape
  Ship takes: a title, then "- " lines from the side of the person playing.
  It is the one parameter taken without its name, so a bare string after the
  script is the note; every other one is given by name (#1929).
  After a successful deploy it posts to the dev updates channel through
  Publish-Discord.ps1 -Dev -GamemodeDeploy, the same embed style as a dev
  Ship, with footer "dev server". Issue #594.

  STAGED, CHECKED, THEN SWAPPED (issue #446). Nothing is copied over the
  running dev server any more. The new files and an edited copy of the dev
  settings go into $Root\.stage-<stamp> while it runs, the box checks them
  there, and only then is anybody warned and the server stopped. If it does
  not answer on its ports afterwards, the old files go back and this exits 1.
  What a run replaced is kept in $Root\.prev-<stamp>, the newest two, and
  -PutBack puts the newest back. See THE STAGE below and Swap.ps1.

  A gamemode change that also changes the CHARGEN records needs
  Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 -Vortex first. Code-only changes do not.

  WHO IS ON, AND A WARNING BEFORE THE STOP.

  Stopping the dev server drops everybody on it. Their games reconnect when it
  comes back and a reconnect is a respawn, which from a chair is a teleport, a
  burst of equipping and an inventory that flashes. On 23 September this
  script did that to Patrick six times in an hour while he was testing: "I
  randomly teleportes as I was typing this and I heard the noise of things
  equipping", and then "I did the teleport thing again, it was while looking
  in the forge". The dev server.log has it: 'gamemode loaded' at 20:39:00.5
  and 'login ff000003 put 2 worn thing(s) back on' at 20:39:47.2, and the same
  pair at 20:44:05.0 and 20:44:52.1. About 47 seconds each time, and not one
  restart request in that log before either of them.

  So it now reads online.json on the dev box before anything is stopped and
  says how many are on, and who: the gamemode keeps their names in
  online-names.json in the private folder, not the served one. Nobody on
  means straight down, as before. Anybody on means
  the same warning Ship.ps1 and Deploy-Server.ps1 give: Request-Restart.ps1
  drops restart.json into the dev server's data folder, the dev gamemode
  announces it in chat and on screen, and this waits out the countdown before
  the stop, leaving early if the room empties. -Mode notice is the default,
  as it is in Deploy-Server, because it puts nobody out; -Mode restart asks
  them to log out and clears the room at zero.

  It will not stop a dev server with people on it without telling them. If
  the warning does not go out, or the box cannot say who is on, it stops
  there and the dev server is left running exactly as it was. -Now is how to
  take it down anyway, for a fix that cannot wait a minute.

  A server that is not running has nobody on it, whatever online.json says.
  The gamemode writes that file only when the count moves, so a killed or
  crashed process leaves its last count behind. The same read asks whether
  anything is on the dev game port, and nothing there means nobody on. And
  the stop removes any restart.json the old process never read, so the next
  one does not find it and count down on its own.

  THE LOAD ORDER, AND WHY -LoadOrder HAD TO EXIST.

  Until 22 September nothing in this repo could move a load order onto the dev
  server. Deploy-Server.ps1 is the live half and refuses this root on purpose.
  This script sent gamemode.js alone. The only thing that ever wrote the dev
  loadOrder was vps-dev-instance.ps1, which runs ON the VPS, copies from live,
  and nothing in the normal dev flow calls it. So the dev server kept whatever
  order it was built with while live moved on, and the client compares the two
  position by position and refuses the session on any disagreement.

  Measured on 22 September. Live was handing out 57 plugins and matched the
  game exactly. The dev server was handing out 60: the order from 21 September,
  still carrying Respawn - Death Overhaul.esp, SunHelmSurvival.esp,
  SunHelmDiseases.esp, TavernGames.esp and Hothtrooper44_Armor_Ecksstra.esp,
  and missing RaceCompatibility.esm and Playable Rieklings.esp. The lists part
  company at position 7 and everything after it is out of place. Its
  Thornswood-Content.esp was 151,288 bytes, which is the stale copy named in
  Deploy-Server.ps1's own comment as the one that stopped going to live that
  same day; the repo has been on 141,234 since. Four things for the launcher to
  find, and Play refused before the game ever started.

  -LoadOrder sends the plugins the load order names that the box does not
  hold at these bytes. With -Dist it rewrites the dev loadOrder to that
  build's, and nothing else about the dev settings is touched: the port, the
  name and the voice port stay the dev ones, which is the whole reason
  Deploy-Server.ps1 is refused here. That list goes up as a file rather than
  inside the settings block, so the dev settings file is edited in place the
  way everything else here edits it. Without -Dist the order is the dev
  server's own and is left as it is (WHERE THE ORDER COMES FROM, below).

  Our own plugin comes from the repo and not from a game folder, for the reason
  written out at length in Deploy-Server.ps1: there have been four copies of
  Thornswood-Content.esp on this machine at three different sizes, and the game
  folder is not the one that is authoritative. It goes up whenever its sha256
  is not the box's, not only its size (#2308): Ship refuses a release whose
  content plugin the server does not hold byte for byte (ServerContent.ps1),
  and a plugin edited to the same length would otherwise be one this run left
  behind and Ship then refused, with no way past either.

  WHERE THE ORDER COMES FROM (#2309). This script runs only from a clean
  checkout at origin (#2118), which on the shipping machine is a fresh
  worktree, and a fresh worktree has no engine build. Until 11 Oct -LoadOrder
  read the order from the built server's server-settings.json under
  Where.ps1 ServerDist inside the checkout, so it could never run from the one
  place the guard lets it: at 10:13 PM and 10:16 PM that day it stopped with
  "-LoadOrder needs the built server's settings", and the run that went out
  had -Dist pointed at another folder's build by hand.

  The order is the server's own. Deploy-Gamemode.ps1, which writes every
  server build's load order, keeps the order the server already runs and only
  puts a new plugin on the end, because the world keys every saved form on a
  plugin's place in it; Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev then installs that
  order on the dev box with the plugins it names (ServerSettings.ps1,
  loadOrder is a release key). So the dev box's own server-settings.json is
  the order the installed server build carries, and it is there for any
  checkout to read. -LoadOrder reads it there, in the same call that reads
  which content plugin the box holds, sends the plugins it names that the box
  does not hold at these bytes, and leaves the order as it is.

  A new order is made by a server build, on the machine that has one, and
  goes out with it (Publish-Server.ps1 -Channel dev). -Dist <that build's
  dist\server> is the way to send only its order and plugins: then the order
  is read from that build and written over the dev one, as -LoadOrder did
  before. Nothing names a build folder by default any more.

  # carries the dev port and name and must not be overwritten from a local
  # build, which is the whole reason this script exists rather than
  # Deploy-Server.ps1. One key is set in place instead, and the old file is
  # kept beside it.
  # WHAT YOU ARE WEARING STAYS ON, and the three keys below are why. Measured on
  # 20 September from the live server.log: 24 refused equipment updates over two
  # days, every one of them 'inventory does not contain item 13790', which is
  # IronWarAxe. Skyrim Unbound hands out starting gear inside the client's own
  # game and the server never sees it happen, so the first equipment update a new
  # character sends names an item the server has no record of, and upstream throws
  # the WHOLE update away for it. The equipment record then stays empty all
  # session, and on the next spawn the client empties the pack and refills it from
  # that empty record, four times in a second and a half. equipmentSlotCheckEnabled
  # and equipmentSpellCheckEnabled are the other two refusals, neither of which the
  # log shows firing, both switchable in our fork already.
  # equipmentInventoryCheckEnabled is the one that matters and it needs the server
  # rebuilt from thornswood/engine-changes before it does anything; an unknown key
  # is ignored until then.
  #
  # AND THE START POINT MOVES WITH THE LOAD ORDER, added 23 September.
  #
  # The block below rewrites loadOrder on the dev box whenever the build's
  # order differs from the one up there. startPoints sits in the same file and
  # holds a form id, and a form id is fileIndex * 0x01000000 + local id, so
  # moving the load order under it silently points it at a different plugin,
  # or at no plugin at all.
  #
  # That is what happened. The dev settings were written on 22 September when
  # Skyrim Unbound.esp was at index 58; the order moved and Unbound is at 54
  # there now, in a list of 57. Every new character on dev died at login with
  #   Error: FromFormId failed due to invalid file index 58  (spawn.ts:38)
  # and the client showed its OOPS box with no way to tell what was wrong.
  # Patrick hit it on 23 September at 18:30.
  #
  # The index is recomputed here from whatever load order this run leaves on
  # the box, and only the index: the local id is kept exactly as it was, so
  # this fixes a moved plugin and never decides where the creation room is.
  # Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 computes the same thing the same way for the live
  # server, which is why live was right and dev was not.
  #
  # AND THE INDEX COUNTS FULL PLUGINS ONLY, added 5 October for #2011. With an
  # engine that loads light plugins (#1715) the list holds them too, and a form
  # id's top byte is a plugin's place among the full plugins, never its place
  # in the list. This counted the list, so the 10:01 PM deploy of 5 October put
  # the start point at 0x5E19BAD4 (Unbound 94th in the list, 45th among full
  # plugins) and every new character died at login with
  #   Error: FromFormId failed due to invalid file index 94 (5e19bad4)
  # It counts with Get-ThornswoodFullIndex now, the one Deploy-Gamemode,
  # Publish-Server and Check-Chargen use, sent up with the block. Which
  # plugins are light is read here, from each header in $Data by the same
  # Test-ThornswoodPluginLight, and goes up as a table; light ones count as
  # unnumbered only when the box's own server-build.json says its engine loads
  # them. A plugin in the box's order that this machine cannot read leaves the
  # start point alone and says so, rather than guessing its index.
  #
  # AND HOW MANY IT HOLDS AT ONCE, #481. thornswoodMostOnline is the number the
  # gamemode turns people away past, and maxPlayers, the engine's own slot
  # count, is set that plus the staff seats, both from records\most-online.json
  # read above, its dev numbers. With no number both are left as the box has them and that does
  # not count as a reason to rewrite.
  #
  # AND NO "default" KEY IN npcSettings, added 28 September for issue #879. The
  # engine reads every key of npcSettings as a plugin name and refuses every NPC
  # when one names no loaded plugin, so {"default": {...}} emptied the world:
  # NPCs showed for a moment and went, or never showed. Deploy-Gamemode stopped
  # writing it in #880, but this script never sends the settings file, so the
  # dev box kept the old one. The key is dropped here and the rest of npcSettings
  # is left as it is.
  #
  # AND THE PEOPLE COME BACK, added 28 September for issue #956. Two more gates
  # in the engine refuse an NPC, both off unless a setting says otherwise, and no
  # script here ever said so: npcAllowCrimeFaction (anyone in a hold's crime
  # faction, which is every guard and nearly every townsperson) and
  # npcAllowEssential (essential, protected and unique actors, which is every
  # named shopkeeper and resident). Animals are in neither, which is why they
  # came back with #879 and the people did not. Measured with the server binary
  # over the dev load order: 1406 of 4942 people in Skyrim.esm load with both
  # off, 3274 with both on; across the other plugins 275 of 1445 against 1243.
  # Belethor, Hulda and Nazeem are refused on both counts. Both are set true
  # here on every run.
  #
  # AND WHETHER A WRONG LOAD ORDER ENDS THE SESSION, added 28 September for
  # #402. -LoadOrderRefuse on sets thornswoodLoadOrderRefuse true, off sets it
  # false, and leaving the switch off keeps whatever the box has. This is the
  # only place the dev settings are edited, so the switch lives here.
  #
  # AND WHETHER A SESSION NEEDS A JOIN PASS, added 28 September for #937.
  # -RequirePass on sets thornswoodRequirePass true, off sets it false, and no
  # switch keeps what the box has. thornswoodServer is always dev here, so a pass
  # the site issued for the live server is refused on this one.
  #
  # AND WHETHER THE SERVER KEEPS NPCS ALIVE, added 28 September for #385.
  # -Npcs off sets npcEnabled false and -Npcs on sets it true, which with the
  # empty npcSettings above is every NPC in the world. Nothing else changes, so
  # the same spot on dev with it off and then on is the before and after.
  #
  # This comment is HERE and not inside the here-string below on purpose. Anything
  # in that string is base64 encoded and sent as an ssh command line, where it
  # counts double and the far end truncates at about 8191 characters. Ten lines of

  # nothing said so. These are handed to the swap, which reads every other key
  # of the staged file back against the running one before it starts anything
  # and puts the old files back when one moved: the read-back #1222 gave
  # Deploy-Server. tests\test-dev-settings-keys.ps1 holds this list to the
