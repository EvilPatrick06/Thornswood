  Set-Turnstile.ps1

  Puts Cloudflare Turnstile's two keys for the report form into the site's
  config.json on the VPS and restarts the site, so /report draws the check
  and the site asks Cloudflare about every pass (#3216, Patrick's answer on
  22 Oct 2026). Or takes both out again with -Off.

    pwsh scripts/deploy/Set-Turnstile.ps1 -FromCloudflare                 the usual way, from anywhere with gh and the box's ssh
    pwsh scripts/deploy/Set-Turnstile.ps1 -PublicSiteKey 0x4AAAAAAA...     asks for the secret, not shown
    pwsh scripts/deploy/Set-Turnstile.ps1 -Off                             no widget and no check

  The site key is public: the page hands it to every browser, so it may go on
  the command line. The secret is never typed into a session, a chat or a
  file, whichever way it comes:

  -FromCloudflare (Patrick's A of 22 Oct, after the Desk refused to read the
  secret through the Cloudflare connector, because a live secret would then
  sit in its transcript). Patrick made a Cloudflare API token that can only
  read Turnstile widgets and pasted it once into the repository's Actions
  secrets as CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_TOKEN. This:
    1. has the box make its seal key if it has none, and print the public
       half (scripts\vps\Seal.ps1);
    2. starts .github/workflows/turnstile-keys.yml on main with that public
       key. The workflow runs this script with -SealOnGitHub, which seals the
       token to the key and leaves only the sealed form, as an annotation;
    3. hands the sealed form to the box, which opens it with its key, asks
       Cloudflare for the widget's secret with the token, and writes the keys.
  The token and the secret exist in plain form only inside the workflow's
  process and on the box.

  -PublicSiteKey alone: the secret is asked for hidden, or read from one line
  of standard input when there is no keyboard (#3359), and goes to the box
  on ssh's standard input (Send-Secret.ps1, #451).

  Only the two keys change in config.json, through SiteConfigSet.ps1, the
  block Deploy-Docs -Password and Rotate-ServerPassword use (#2317): every
  other setting is kept, and a file that is there and will not parse is left
  exactly as it is, with nothing written and the site not restarted. The
  site key is written first, so a run that stops between the two leaves the
  site key alone, which the site reads as off (turnstileOn() wants both).

  Afterwards it asks the restarted site what the report form is told
  (/api/report/form on the box itself) and says whether the check is on.
