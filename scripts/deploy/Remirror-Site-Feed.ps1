  Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1

  Puts the release feed on the site, so https://thornswood.net/feed/version.json
  is the same file as this machine's working copy of the feed and every asset
  it names can be downloaded from thornswood.net.

  SINCE #907 THE VPS IS WHERE THE FEED LIVES. Publish-Update.ps1 receives it
  from there and sends it back itself (scripts\release\Feed-Store.ps1), so
  after a Ship this finds version.json up there already and only checks the
  assets. version.json goes up through the same Feed-Store check as a Ship: it
  replaces the site's copy only while that copy is still the one this machine
  received, and the one it replaces is kept in the feed's history folder.
  Handed a folder that was never received (-FeedDir at an old clone), it
  replaces whatever the site has, the way it always did, and says so.

  WHY IT EXISTS. Since the #649 host cutover a launcher reads version.json from
  the site (the GitHub fallback it had went with #907), and Publish-Update.ps1
  writes pack, launcher and clientRuntime urls
  as https://thornswood.net/feed/assets/<sha256>. Its own comment says "Website
  mirrors the bytes to /feed/assets/<sha256>", and nothing did: the mirror was
  somebody copying files by hand. A feed published without it points every
  launcher at bytes that answer 404, and a 404 on a pack fails the whole update
  and leaves Play off.

  WHAT IT SENDS, and in this order, because the order is the safety:

    1. every asset the feed names that is missing up there, each one to
       <sha256>.part and then renamed, so a dropped connection cannot leave a
       short file sitting at the name of its own hash
    2. version.json, last, and only when every asset it names is up there

  So the worst a failed run leaves is a site feed one release behind, which is
  what launchers were already reading, rather than a feed pointing at nothing.
  Nothing is ever deleted: an asset the current feed does not name is left
  alone, because an older feed may still name it.

      .\scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 -Check   says what it would send
      .\scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1          the live feed, to /feed
      .\scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 -Dev     the dev feed, to /feed-dev
      .\scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 -Verify  re-sends any asset up
                                                       there whose bytes do not
                                                       hash to its own name
      .\scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 -AssetDir D:\packs
                                                       another folder to look
                                                       for the bytes in

  HOW SHIP SHOULD CALL IT. After the release is published and before the news
  step, one line:

      & (Join-Path $Here '..\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1') -Dev:$Dev

  in a try/catch, the way Ship calls Publish-News.ps1. It exits 1 when it
  refused to publish the feed, which is a line on screen for whoever shipped
  rather than a reason to fail a release that is already out.

  SENDING ASSETS ON THEIR OWN (#897). Since updates come from the site rather
  than from GitHub, Publish-Update.ps1 sends each new pack, the
  launcher and the client runtime up BEFORE it writes version.json, with

      .\scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 [-Dev] -Send <file>, <file>

  which sends exactly those files to /feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256> (by the same
  .part then rename), skips any already up there, never touches version.json,
  and exits 1 when one did not land. Copy-ReleaseAssets-ToSite.ps1 uses it too.

  -SiteDir <folder> stands in for the site's feed root on this machine: every
  list, send and rename happens in that folder and nothing connects to the
  VPS. The tests use it, with a copy of site\server.js serving that folder.

  Nothing about the installer's VirusTotal report is this script's business.
  That upload belongs to whoever publishes the installer, and
  scripts\release\Publish-Installer.ps1 says what the site needs from it.

  Reads this machine's working copy of the feed, and writes only to the site's
  feed folders.
