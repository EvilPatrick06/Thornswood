  ServerContent.ps1

  Which Thornswood-Content.esp a game server holds, read off the box, and
  whether a release may send clients a content plugin that server does not
  hold (#2308). Dot-sourced by Publish-Update.ps1 (the release),
  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 and Deploy-Server.ps1 (the server half); defines
  functions and nothing else. Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and
  PowerShell 7.

  WHY, issue #2308. On 11 Oct the dev Ship 20261011-221215-dev sent clients a
  new Data\Thornswood-Content.esp (146,381 bytes), posted to the dev updates
  channel, told the dev server to restart and pushed its tag, while the dev
  server still had the old one (146,446 bytes). Ship and the server deploy
  are two runs, and nothing in the release asked what the server held. For
  eight minutes every dev client that updated held a content plugin the
  server it joined did not.

  THE RULE. The server gets the content plugin first, then the Ship. A
  release whose Data\Thornswood-Content.esp is not the one the channel's last
  release carried (the baseline Publish-Update already diffs against) is
  refused, before anything is packed, sent, posted or told to a server,
  unless that channel's server already holds the same plugin: the same size
  and the same sha256, read from the box. The refusal names the command that
  sends it there (Get-ThornswoodContentCommand).

  READ OVER SSH, NOT THE MANIFEST. Each server also lists its plugins over
  plain HTTP (the resources port's manifest.json, 7788 for dev and 3000 for
  live), and that answers from machines where ssh is refused. It is not used
  here, for three measured reasons. It gives a size and a crc32 for each
  plugin and no sha256, so two plugins of one size and a colliding crc32
  pass. It is what the running process loaded at its last start, not the
  file on disk the next start loads and a deploy has just written. And it
  does not answer at all while the server is down or restarting, which is
  exactly when a deploy has just put a plugin there. The plugins folder on
  the box is what the server will load, and every Ship already needs ssh to
  the same box: Feed-Store.ps1 receives the feed and the baseline over it,
  so a machine that can Ship can make this read.

  A READ THAT GETS NO ANSWER IS A REFUSAL. No answer is not "the server has
  it": a release is refused when the box does not say which plugin it holds.

  The far side's text ($ThornswoodServerContentText) runs on the box under
  Windows PowerShell 5.1, so it is ASCII and uses .NET for the sha256 rather
  than Get-FileHash, which a 5.1 started from PowerShell 7 cannot always
  load.

  THE HARNESS STAND-IN. tests\test-2308-content-before-ship.ps1 and
  tests\test-2309-loadorder-fresh.ps1 run the same far side text in place on
  a folder standing in for the server root. That folder is used only when
  THORNSWOOD_HARNESS is 1, THORNSWOOD_TEST_SERVER_DIR names it, and the box
  the read would go to is one that can never be a real server (the hosts
  Fresh-Checkout.ps1 lets the harness use), so a stray variable can never
  make a real release read a local folder as the box.
