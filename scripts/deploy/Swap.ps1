  Swap.ps1

  Stages a deploy beside what is running, checks it there, and only then swaps it in, keeping what it replaced for a one-command put-back.

  Dot-sourced by the scripts that change something running on the VPS:
  Deploy-Server.ps1 and Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 (the game servers, the first
  pair of blocks below), and Deploy-Docs.ps1, Install-Voice.ps1 and
  Install-Bot.ps1 (the site, the voice service and the bot, the second pair).
  Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 does the same for a whole server folder, on the
  box itself, with folders beside the root instead of files inside it.

  WHY, issue #446: "A failed publish deletes the live server before checking
  the new one." Measured on 28 September, every one of those scripts but
  Deploy-Server wrote over the running copy first and found out afterwards
  whether the new one worked, and none of them could put the old one back.
  The shape Deploy-Server was given for entry 209 is the one they all use now:

    1. Every new file goes up into <root>\.stage-<stamp> while the old one
       runs. A failed copy stops the run with nothing touched.
    2. The box checks the stage: every file hashed against what left this
       machine, the settings parsed, the program parsed (node --check, or
       Python's own parser). A refusal clears the stage and stops nothing.
    3. Only then the stop, one rename per file (what it replaces goes into
       <root>\.prev-<stamp>), and the same for a directory named in $Dirs;
       for a caller that names what else at its root is its own ($Owns, the
       bot, issue #1184), whatever is there that it did not send goes into
       .prev the same way; then the start, and a check that it answers.
    4. If a rename fails, or it does not answer, the old files go back, the
       old one is started again, and the run says SWAP ROLLED BACK and exits 1.

  The stop waits for each process it stopped to have exited, and each rename
  is tried once, saying why when Windows refuses it (StopAndMove.ps1, whose
  text goes in front of both swap blocks, #2928).

  The newest two .prev folders are kept, and the newest two .undone ones
  (Patrick, 29 Sep, #1121: two, not three). -PutBack on each of those
  scripts puts the newest one back the same checked way, and keeps what it
  took out in <root>\.undone-<stamp>, so a put-back can itself be put back by
  hand.

  What runs on the box is kept here as single quoted text, so what goes up is
  plain PowerShell a person can read and the harnesses can run against a
  scratch folder (tests\test-deploy-server-swap.ps1, tests\test-deploy-swaps.ps1).
  Keep it ASCII: a laptop on PowerShell 7 writes the file Remote sends without
  a byte order mark, and Windows PowerShell 5.1 at the far end reads it as ANSI.

  $Wait in the swap is how long both ports may take. Left off on the caller,
  it is the shared ceiling in ServerReadyWait.ps1, derived from measured Live
  and Dev starts (#1938).

# ==== deploy-server remote blocks ====
#
# THE TWO HALVES THAT RUN ON THE BOX, KEPT HERE SO A HARNESS CAN RUN THEM TOO.
#
# Written for Deploy-Server.ps1 and moved here for issue #446, so the dev
# server's deploy (Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1) stages, checks and swaps with the
# same two blocks rather than a copy of them.
#
# Entry 209 on the To Do List: "Upload to a staging path, verify there, the
# shortest possible stop, an atomic rename, a real health check." And: "This
# is the script that runs most often and has the least protection." Until
# then it stopped the server, copied over the running folder, waited six
# seconds, and printed SERVER IS NOT LISTENING without exiting non-zero,
# putting anything back, asking the resources port or checking the load order
# on the box.
#
# $checkBlock runs while the server is still up and touches nothing but the
# stage. $swapBlock is the only part that stops anything, and it does the
# stop, the renames, the start, the health check and the way back in one
# script, so a connection that drops between two ssh calls cannot leave the
# server stopped with half its files moved.
#
# Both are single quoted and take their values from the lines SwapVars puts in
# front of them, so what goes to the box is plain PowerShell a person can read
# and tests\test-deploy-server-swap.ps1 can run against a scratch folder. Each
# ends with one line the caller reads: STAGE OK or STAGE REFUSED, and SWAP OK,
# SWAP ROLLED BACK, SWAP REFUSED or SWAP FAILED. A line and not an exit code,
# because Remote sends a long script as a file and the exit code left behind
# is the one from deleting that file.
#
# Keep them ASCII. A laptop on PowerShell 7 writes that file without a byte
# order mark, and Windows PowerShell 5.1 at the far end then reads it as ANSI.
#
# $checkBlock calls ServerBuild.ps1, beside this file, whose text is put in
# front of it below the end marker, so the stage's server files are held to
# the record sent with them by the same lines that hold a payload and a build
# (#1214).
