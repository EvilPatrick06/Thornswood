  Rotate-ServerPassword.ps1

  Changes the server password and hands the new one to the site, so the
  launcher can fetch it after checking Discord.

  This is what makes a ban stick. Someone removed from the Discord cannot get a
  new password, but they still have the last one, so after a ban you rotate and
  their copy stops connecting.

    .\Rotate-ServerPassword.ps1
    .\Rotate-ServerPassword.ps1 -Password      asks for one you chose, not shown
    .\Rotate-ServerPassword.ps1 -Minutes 10 -Why 'a ban'

  READ THIS FIRST. It used to also write the password into the game server's
  settings and restart it, and that step was always a lie. SkyMP has no join
  password: there is no sPassword in server-settings.json, nothing in
  gamemode.js reads one, and the field only exists in the launcher's config
  because the old multiplayer mod had a join screen and SkyMP does not.

  So what this actually changes is which password the SITE hands out, and that
  is all it changes. The game server itself is open to anyone who knows the
  address and port, with or without this. The thing that will close it is a
  check in gamemode.js on connect, and that does not exist yet.

  Which means this is still worth running after a ban, because it stops a
  removed person's launcher from getting a live answer out of the site. It is
  not a door, it is a bolt on one door out of two.

  What it does, in order:

    1. Makes a new password, or asks for yours without showing it. Never
       type it on the command line: a typed value stays in the shell's
       history file (issue #1069).
    2. Writes it into the site's config, so the launcher can be handed it.

  It no longer touches the game server or restarts it, because there was
  nothing to write there and the restart threw everybody out for nothing.

  On a launcher older than 1.0.197 the password comes out of version.json
  rather than the site, so those copies keep whatever they last read. Once
  1.0.197 is out and everyone has it, this starts biting properly.
