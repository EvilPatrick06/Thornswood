  Set-DiscordOnboarding.ps1

  Sets Discord's onboarding (Server Settings, Onboarding) with the bot, from
  bot\Build-Onboarding.py: the default channels, the questions and what each
  answer gives, every role and channel looked up by name on the server when it
  runs. Issue #427.

    .\Set-DiscordOnboarding.ps1 -Check     reads the server, says what it would
                                           set and what Discord would refuse,
                                           changes nothing. Always run this first.
    .\Set-DiscordOnboarding.ps1 -Off       writes it but leaves onboarding off,
                                           so Preview can be walked first
    .\Set-DiscordOnboarding.ps1            writes it and switches it on

  Choices, all off unless given:
    -GrantMember   the hold question from the board, which gives everybody who
                   answers Member and a Citizen role. Off keeps the application
                   gate: Member stays something staff give.
    -Rules         a required "have you read the rules" question
    -Age           a required "are you 18 or over" question

  The bot needs Manage Server and Manage Roles for this. Its role keeps
  Administrator (#3317, Patrick, 22 Oct 2026), which covers both.

  It asks for the token rather than taking it on the command line, so it stays
  out of your history. Nothing writes it to disk.
