  ServiceAccount.ps1

  The account the services that run code we deploy run as (#2578): both game
  servers, both voice services and Caddy. Until 16 Oct 2026 each of their
  installers registered its task as SYSTEM at the highest run level, so
  anything gamemode.js, voice-server.js or caddy.exe did, it did as SYSTEM:
  every secret on the box, the backups and their passphrase, the runners.

  Now each task runs as NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE, Limited, the way the
  site already does (Deploy-Docs.ps1 -RunAs, which says why each part is
  there):
    - SeChangeNotifyPrivilege and no other privilege. LOCAL SERVICE is given
      "Impersonate a client" and "Replace a process level token" by default,
      and either can be turned into SYSTEM, so the task asks for the one it
      needs and is started without the rest.
    - ProcessTokenSidType Unrestricted, which puts a SID of the task's own
      (NT TASK\<task name>) in its token. Every grant below goes to that SID,
      not to LOCAL SERVICE, so the site and the other services, which are
      LOCAL SERVICE too, get nothing from them.

  A task's folder (Grant-ThornswoodServiceFolder):
    - the root and everything in it: read and execute, so the code the deploy
      put there is readable and nothing in it can be changed or deleted;
    - the root itself: make files and folders in it, for the logs and the
      folders a first start makes. CREATOR OWNER gets Modify on what it makes,
      so a log the service started it can write to, roll and cut, and a file
      somebody else put there it cannot;
    - the folders it keeps its state in (-Writable): Modify;
    - files already there that it must keep writing (-Files, the logs a
      SYSTEM task left behind): Modify on each.

  WHO OWNS WHAT A SERVICE MAKES (#4077). Windows makes the owner of a new
  file the token's default owner, and for a LOCAL SERVICE task that is LOCAL
  SERVICE, not the task's own SID: measured on the box on 27 Oct 2026, every
  Thornswood task's token had owner S-1-5-19. So CREATOR OWNER above became
  "LOCAL SERVICE: Modify" on each file a service made, and the owner's own
  right to read and change a file's rules went to LOCAL SERVICE as well:
  every service on the box could read and change the others' logs, worlds,
  chat logs and backups. The same measurement found the task's own SID in
  the token with the flag that lets it be owner (0xe), so each task now
  starts through thornswood-owner.exe (Get-ThornswoodOwnerLaunchSource),
  which makes that SID the default owner and then runs the task's program,
  whose children inherit it. CREATOR OWNER then names that one service, and
  so does every file's owner. Set-ThornswoodTaskOwner puts the launcher on
  a task once its folder is granted, and Repair-ThornswoodServiceOwner gives
  the task what LOCAL SERVICE made in its folders before, with the rules
  CREATOR OWNER gave LOCAL SERVICE made again for the new owner. The
  launcher is built on the box by the .NET Framework's compiler, the way the
  bot's service program is, into Program Files, where only Administrators
  can change it. -AsSystem needs none of it: SYSTEM's files are SYSTEM's.

  THE FAIL-SAFE (Test-ThornswoodServiceCannotReach). Before any installer
  moves a task to LOCAL SERVICE it reads the rules on the places no service
  may read (Get-ThornswoodServiceNeverReach), and refuses, with nothing
  changed, when Everyone, Authenticated Users, Users or LOCAL SERVICE may read
  one. -AsSystem on each installer registers the task as it was, SYSTEM and
  Highest, and is the way back.

  Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 runs on the box and carries a copy of these
  functions (every file Publish-Server.ps1 sends is a recorded remote call);
  the test fails when the copy differs. Install-Voice.ps1 and
  Setup-Domain.ps1 run on this machine, so they send the functions as text
  inside the script they run on the box (Get-ThornswoodServiceAccountScript).
  tests\test-2578-service-principals.ps1 runs it on scratch folders, and
  tests\test-4077-service-owner.ps1 builds the launcher and runs it.
