  Install-Voice.ps1

  Puts the proximity voice service on the VPS beside the game server and opens
  the one port it needs. Run it from this machine; it does the remote half
  over ssh.

  How the thing works, in three lines:
    the gamemode pushes everyone's position to the voice service five times a
    second, over loopback on the VPS. Everyone's browser holds a WebSocket to
    that service for positions and for WebRTC signalling. The audio itself goes
    straight between people and never touches the server.

  Positions come from the game server rather than from anybody's game, so voice
  works whichever SkyMP client somebody runs, and nobody can move their own
  voice around by editing a file on their machine.

      .\Install-Voice.ps1 -Restart     stop it, wait until it has exited, start
                                       it again under the task it has, sending
                                       no file, and check it answers
      .\Install-Voice.ps1 -TaskOnly    register its task again with this
                                       install's settings and restart it under
                                       it, sending no file (#2491); the task
                                       it had goes back if it does not answer
      .\Install-Voice.ps1 -Remove      take it off again

  STAGED, CHECKED, THEN SWAPPED, issue #446.

  This used to copy voice-server.js and the page straight over the running
  service, then stop it, re-register it and start it, and say "voice did not
  come up" with nothing put back and an exit code of 0. The page changed under
  everybody the moment it was copied, whatever the service did next.

  Now the files go into $Root\.stage-<stamp> while the service runs, the
  box checks them there (each by its hash, voice-server.js through
  node --check), and nothing is stopped if that fails. Then Swap.ps1's service
  swap stops it, renames them in (what they replace goes to
  $Root\.prev-<stamp>), registers the task with this install's settings and
  starts it, and asks /health for the build that was sent. If that is not what
  answers, the old files go back, the task goes back exactly as it was
  (exported before anything changed), and it is started again. -PutBack puts
  the newest .prev folder back and leaves the task as it is.

# Oct 2026 it was cmd's >> voice.log 2>&1 with roll-log.ps1 in front, and cmd
# holds that file open for as long as node runs, so voice.log was rolled only
# at a start, by size, five kept, and nothing aged it: a voice service that
# was not restarted kept one file growing, holding profile numbers and
# character names, for as long as it ran. Decided by Patrick on 17 Oct
# (#2166, G5): voice.log goes after 90 days. server-log.js holds the file
# itself, so it rolls it at midnight and at 4 MB and cuts every rolled copy
# to 90 days (--days 90), at a start, at each roll and once an hour, and the
# copies roll-log.ps1 left (.1 to .5) the same way. Voice's own lines carry
# no time, so --stamp puts one in front of each; that is what lets a line be
# aged. The relay line, when there is one, sits with the other settings, so
# it is set in this cmd before node starts.
#
# node goes through cmd's start /high, so it runs High (#2491, the task's
# settings below say why), and server-log.js gives voice its own priority as
# it starts it: /b keeps it in this cmd's console, so the environment holds,
# and /wait keeps the task running until voice ends. server-log.js ends with
# voice's exit code and start leaves cmd's exit code 0 whatever that was, so

  Stop the old service, and mean it.

  A bare Unregister-ScheduledTask leaves the process it started running, so
  the old node kept the port, the new one died on the bind, and every check
  connected to the orphan and called it success: days of voice-server changes
  went to disk and never ran. So: find what is ours and open it, stop the
  task, end whatever of ours is still running, and wait until each of them has
  exited (StopAndMove.ps1, #2928), so the port is free and no file is still
  open when the swap renames it. Until 20 Oct this waited for the port to let
  go instead, fifteen seconds at most, and the renames were tried ten times.

  Ours, and only ours. This used to kill every node running voice-server.js,
  whatever folder it ran from, and there are two of these services, live and
  dev: on 18 September installing dev stopped live. A process is ours if it
  was started from this root, which the log path in its parent cmd's command
  line shows (node's own line is bare, node.exe voice-server.js, measured on
  the box 18 September), or if it sits on the port we are about to bind.
  NOTE the backtick on the log: it belongs to the far side, and written bare
  the outer PowerShell expands it to nothing and the test matches every voice
  process there is, which is how this killed live twice on 18 September.

  What "working" looks like depends on the bind, and it used to not.

  This reached for the raw address and called silence a failure. Once the
  service is on loopback that silence is the entire point, so a correct install
  printed "Installed, but nothing is answering" in red. That is how somebody
  panics and reverts a change that worked, which is worse than the change
  having failed.

  So: on 0.0.0.0 the port must answer. On 127.0.0.1 it must NOT, and the
