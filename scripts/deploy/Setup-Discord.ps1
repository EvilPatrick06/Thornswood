  Setup-Discord.ps1

  Builds the Thornswood Discord: roles, categories, channels, permissions and
  the words in the read only channels, in one run.

  Run it again any time. Anything already there is left alone and anything
  missing is made. It does NOT rewrite the read only posts unless you ask, so
  a run to add one channel no longer deletes and re-sends every rule, welcome
  and faq message in the server.

    .\Setup-Discord.ps1            roles, channels, permissions, settings
    .\Setup-Discord.ps1 -Posts     also rewrites the read only posts from
                                    content.py. Use this when the wording moved.
    .\Setup-Discord.ps1 -Check     changes nothing at all, just says what it
                                    would do
    .\Setup-Discord.ps1 -Prune     also deletes channels this no longer wants
    .\Setup-Discord.ps1 -OnBox     runs the build on the VPS with the token the
                                    running bot already holds, and asks for
                                    nothing. Goes with -Check, -Posts and -Prune

  First time only, before running it:

    1. https://discord.com/developers/applications
       The same application the website login uses is fine, or make a new one.
    2. Bot in the sidebar, then Reset Token, and copy what it gives you.
    3. Still under Bot, turn ON "Server Members Intent". Leave the rest off.
    4. OAuth2, URL Generator, tick "bot" and then "Administrator". Open the URL
       it builds and add the bot to your server. Administrator is for the build
       only: it makes the Owner and Dev roles, which carry Administrator, and
       Discord refuses that from a bot without it.

  Two permission sets. Administrator for a build, and a smaller set for the
  rest of the time, which is all the running bot needs. A build that finishes
  with nothing failed ends on the invite link with that smaller set and a line
  saying to untick Administrator on the bot's role. Tick it again before the
  next build. To see that link without building anything, from the repository
  folder, with the id from the developer portal's General Information page:

    python bot\Build-Discord.py --invite <application id>
    5. Server Settings, Roles: drag the bot's own role to the TOP. It cannot
       make roles above itself.
    6. Server Settings, Enable Community, so forums, the announcement channel
       and the rules screen exist at all.

  It asks for the token rather than taking it on the command line, so it stays
  out of your history. Nothing writes it to disk.

  -OnBox asks for nothing (#2519, #2341). The token is the bot's own, in
  C:\Thornswood-Bot\bot.env.json on the VPS, so a machine with the VPS key
  and no token, or a run with nobody at a prompt, can still build, and the
  token never leaves the box. Build-Discord.py, content.py and
  staff-channel.txt go up inside the run's script as the commit holds them,
  with the two site pages content.py reads its words from (join.md and
  rules.md), each at its place in the repository, because content.py finds
  them by its own folder (..\site\data\site). An uncommitted change to any
  of them stops the run before the box is asked anything. They go into a
  folder of the run's own under C:\Windows\Temp.
  There the box's Python runs the build with the bot's own libraries
  (py-libs), the token is read from bot.env.json into that one process's
  environment, and the folder is removed when the build ends. The build may
  write the news webhook into that folder; it goes with the folder, because
  the box already keeps the webhook (Discord-Hook.ps1). The running bot holds
  the smaller permission set, not Administrator, so anything that needs
  Administrator is named under "did not manage".
