  ServerArtifact.ps1

  The server build as a versioned artifact, kept in the box's store beside the
  gamemode artifacts. Issue #459.

      . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'ServerArtifact.ps1')

  WHY. A server deploy sent the fork's build straight out of one machine's
  engine build folder, and the box kept no copy of it by name: the installed
  folder and the two folders before it, then nothing. So which engine build a
  server ran could be read off its server-build.json, but those bytes could
  not be fetched again, sent to the other server, or put back once the
  folders before it had rolled off. The gamemode has been an artifact with a
  name since #1090; the server build was the half without one.

  THE ARTIFACT. Exactly the files records\server-build.json lists (the binary,
  the JavaScript half and its map, package.json, yarn.lock, launch_server.bat
  and the compiled Papyrus; ServerBuild.ps1 says which), each held to its
  sha256 in the record as it is read, and the record itself as
  server-build.json, in one stored zip written the way Artifact.ps1 writes
  every artifact (entries in ordinal order, every date 2000-01-01), named

      server-<fork commit, 12>-<sha256 of the zip, 16>.zip

  The record goes in with each CR LF read as LF, the way ServerBuild.ps1 sums
  it, so a checkout with core.autocrlf and one without make the same bytes:
  the same record and the same build give the same name on any machine.
  Beside it, <same name>.json: component server, the fork commit, the zip's
  sha256 and size, recordSha256 (Get-ThornswoodRecordSum of the record), and
  every file with its size and sha256. Nothing in the server folder that is
  not the fork's build goes in: not the gamemode, the settings, the stamp or
  the plugins, which a deploy sends on their own.

  -From is an engine build's dist\server (Deploy-Server.ps1) or a payload zip
  (Publish-Server.ps1, which keeps the files it installed, read out of the zip
  it sent). Either way a file the record does not name the way it is there,
  or a server file it does not list, refuses the artifact and nothing is
  written.

  The store keeps it at C:\Thornswood-Deploys\server\<name>.zip and .json,
  sent by Send-ThornswoodArtifact (Artifact.ps1), which checks the bytes on
  the box. tests\test-459-server-artifact.ps1.

<#
  A SERVER BUILD FROM THE STORE, OR SENT TO IT (#459). Publish-Server.ps1
  -FromStore and Deploy-Server.ps1 -FromStore deploy the build
  records\server-build.json names out of the box's store, from a machine with
  no engine build. The box does the taking and holding
  (Expand-ThornswoodStoredServerBuild, ServerBuild.ps1); these are this side's
  halves.

  Get-ThornswoodStoredServerBuild asks the box, before anything is sent,
  which zips the store keeps for the record's commit, and picks the one whose
  .json names this record's sum. $ThornswoodServerStoreListText is what runs
  there: it reads the .json files and prints a line each, and nothing else.

  Test-ThornswoodServerBuildArtifact holds a server zip on this machine (one
  CI made, engine.yml's artifact) to the record the same way the box will,
  with the same function, so -ServerBuild sends only a zip that is the build
  the commit records. It returns the artifact as New-ThornswoodServerBuildArtifact
  does, for Send-ThornswoodArtifact, which checks the bytes on the box.
