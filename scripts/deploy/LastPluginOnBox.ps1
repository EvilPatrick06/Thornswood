  LastPluginOnBox.ps1

  Thornswood-Last.esp on a game server, made on the box from its recipe
  (#2791 step 2, Patrick's A of 26 Oct 2026 on #3721). The plugin copies the
  winning record of each cell, world, quest and placed actor it changes out of
  about 31 other authors' plugins, so it is never sent from anywhere: no
  repository holds it, and no deploy carries it. The box makes it from the
  plugins its servers already load, which the collection installed, and the
  string tables of its game archive store (C:\Thornswood-GameData, OnBox.ps1
  says what is there and why), by scripts\mods\Make-LastPlugin.py, the same
  apply() the builder checks every recipe with and the launcher runs in C#.

  WHERE IT GOES. Into the deploy's stage, beside the plugins the deploy sent,
  and nowhere else: the stage check (Swap.ps1 $checkBlock) holds it to the
  sha256 game\data\last-plugin.json names, with every file the deploy sent,
  and the swap puts it in with them. A refusal leaves the server as it was.

  WHAT IT READS, in order: the stage's plugins folder first, so the content
  plugin this deploy sends is the one read, then the server's own. A plugin
  of another revision, or another content plugin than the one the recipe was
  written for, makes nothing, and the deploy stops naming it.

  HOW. One run's folder on the box, held by its keeper (Open-ThornswoodOnBoxFolder
  in OnBox.ps1), takes a zip of the four files the make needs, as this commit
  holds them (New-ThornswoodArtifact): Make-LastPlugin.py, last_recipe.py,
  bsa.py and the recipe. Its script finds Python the way a box run does and
  runs the make; the keeper removes the folder after.

  Defines variables and functions and nothing else. Needs Artifact.ps1 and
  ..\vps\Send-Script.ps1 loaded. LastPluginRecipe.ps1, which it loads, reads
  the recipe and manifest with no box. tests\test-2791-last-on-box.ps1 holds it.
