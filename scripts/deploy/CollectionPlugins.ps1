  CollectionPlugins.ps1

  Holds the plugins a deploy sends to the collection's own bytes (#2019).
  A full deploy (Deploy-Server.ps1, Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -LoadOrder) sends
  a plugin from the deploying machine's -Data whenever its size differs from
  the box's copy. Nothing held those files to the collection, so on 5 Oct a
  3BBB.esp from another installer choice (3,288 bytes, not the collection's
  20,257) went to both servers and blocked Play for everybody who installed
  the collection.

  records\collection-plugins.json is the collection's plugins, one row each:

      { "version": 1,
        "builtBy": "scripts/mods/New-CollectionPluginRecord.ps1",
        "collection": "7essxf", "revision": 2,
        "plugins": [ { "name": "3BBB.esp", "size": 20257, "sha256": "ce4f..." } ] }

  scripts\mods\New-CollectionPluginRecord.ps1 writes it from a folder.

      Assert-ThornswoodCollectionPlugins -RecordPath <json> -Files <paths> -What 'this deploy'

  Throws, naming every plugin it would send that is not in the record, or is
  in it at another size or sha256. Only the plugins about to go are read, so
  a deploy that sends nothing reads nothing. Our own plugins
  ($ThornswoodRepoPlugins, RepoPlugins.ps1) are built in this repo and sent
  from it, so they are never in the record and are passed in -Exempt. With no record at all, a deploy that would send any
  other plugin is refused: the record is the only thing that can say those
  bytes are the collection's, and sending them unchecked is what #2019 was.

  Dot-sourced by the two deploy scripts; defines functions and nothing else.
  Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.
