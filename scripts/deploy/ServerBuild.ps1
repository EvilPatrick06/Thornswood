  ServerBuild.ps1

  Which server files come from the fork, and whether a folder, a zip or a
  stage holds the build records\server-build.json names. Dot-sourced by
  New-ServerBuildRecord.ps1, Export-ServerPayload.ps1, Publish-Server.ps1,
  Deploy-Server.ps1, Check-ShipReady.ps1 and Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 (on
  the box, from beside it: Publish-Server.ps1 sends the three together).
  Deploy-Server also sends this file's text to the box in front of Swap.ps1's
  $checkBlock, so the stage is held to the record there.

  WHY, issues #1200 and #1214. The record named one file, scam_native.node.
  The server is more than that: the fork's build also writes the JavaScript
  half the server runs (dist_back\skymp5-server.js, from skymp5-server\ts),
  its source map, and the compiled Papyrus the server's script machine loads.
  Nothing recorded those, so on 29 September nobody could say which fork
  commit the JavaScript running on dev was built from, and a publish would
  have sent any one it found beside the recorded binary.

  THE FILES, by where the fork's CMake writes them into build\dist\server:
    scam_native.node                 skymp5-server, the Node addon
    dist_back\skymp5-server.js       skymp5-server-ts (yarn build-ts, esbuild),
    dist_back\skymp5-server.js.map   which skymp5-server depends on
    package.json, yarn.lock          skymp5-server's post-build step, copied
                                     from skymp5-server
    launch_server.bat                skymp5-server's post-build step
    data\scripts\*                   skymp5-scripts' post-build step, the
                                     fork's compiled Papyrus
  Not these: scam_native.pdb (symbols, never shipped), and gamemode.js and
  server-settings.json, which the fork writes as placeholders and our own
  scripts replace (Deploy-Gamemode.ps1, Publish-Server.ps1).

  THE RECORD lists every one under files, each with its sha256, its size and
  the fork commit it was built from, which is the record's one commit
  (source.commit). sha256 at the top stays the binary's. A folder holds the
  record when every listed file is there with its hash, and no other file of
  those kinds is: a second addon, or a script in dist_back or data\scripts
  that the build did not record, is a server file from somewhere else.

  Keep it ASCII and Windows PowerShell 5.1: it runs on the box.

  Which build a running server is, for a deploy that sends no server files
  (Deploy-Server.ps1 -GamemodeOnly, issue #1089). The box keeps the record the
  last full deploy sent beside the files, as $Root\server-build.json, and a
  gamemode-only deploy goes ahead only when that is the record the commit
  being deployed holds, so the gamemode comes from a commit whose recorded
  server build is the one running.

  Byte for byte, once each CR LF is read as LF. The record is a text file in
  git (git ls-files --eol, 5 Oct: i/lf w/crlf), so a machine with
  core.autocrlf true checks it out with CR LF and one without checks it out
  with LF, and a full deploy sends whichever the deploying machine has. Both
  are the same commit's record; any other difference is another record.

  Kept as text as well, because Deploy-Server puts it in front of the scripts
  it runs on the box, where this file is not.

  A RECORDED BUILD OUT OF THE BOX'S STORE (#459). Since #2467 every
  Publish-Server.ps1 and full Deploy-Server.ps1 keeps the server build it sends
  in the box's store, C:\Thornswood-Deploys\server, as
  server-<fork commit 12>-<zip hash 16>.zip with its .json (ServerArtifact.ps1
  makes them). Publish-Server.ps1 -FromStore and Deploy-Server.ps1 -FromStore
  put the build records\server-build.json names onto a server from there, so a
  machine with no engine build can deploy one. This runs on the box, in the
  installer's stage or Deploy-Server's, and puts that build's files into
  $Into, held to the record exactly as a build sent from a machine is:

    - the store's .json for the record's commit whose recordSha256 is the
      record's own sum (Get-ThornswoodRecordSum, so CR LF and LF are one
      record), and exactly one: the same record and build always make the
      same zip (ServerArtifact.ps1), so two would be a store that lies;
    - the zip's sha256 is its .json's and begins as its name says;
    - the zip holds the record's files and server-build.json, nothing else;
      each file's sha256 is the record's, and the server-build.json in it
      sums to the record;
    - written into $Into, the files are read again and held to the record
      with Get-ThornswoodServerBuildProblems, the check every stage gets.

  Returns Name (the zip's, '' when nothing was taken), Said (lines to print)
  and Problem ('' or why nothing was taken). Only the record's files are
  written; on a problem some may be there, and the caller clears its stage.
  A store .json for the commit that does not read is a problem too: the store
  then cannot say which build it keeps. It reads them with
  ConvertFrom-ThornswoodJson, so the caller has Read-JsonFile.ps1 loaded: the
  installer does, and Deploy-Server sends its text in front of this file's.
