  Deploy-Server.ps1

  Sends the built server up to the VPS and restarts it.

  Warns first, but does not evict anybody.

  Stopping and starting the server reads from a chair as a freeze and then
  everything carrying on, because the client holds its session across it. So
  the default is a short notice saying a push is coming and not to be mid
  fight, then the push. Throwing people out for that would be a bigger
  interruption than the thing being warned about.

  Use -Mode restart when the server really is going down for a while. That one
  counts down properly and clears the room before touching anything.


  A server that is not listening has nobody on it, whatever online.json says.
  And the stop removes any restart.json the old process never read, so the
  next one does not find it and count down on its own.
  The load order goes up with its paths rewritten to the VPS plugin folder,
  and any plugin it names that the box does not have goes up with it. The
  file in the build keeps this machine's paths; only the copy sent changes.

  Copy to a stage, check it there, and only then stop. scam_native.node is a
  loaded image while node is running and Windows will not let you overwrite a
  mapped file, so a copy over a live server fails halfway and leaves a server
  that starts against a file which is half old and half new. That was why
  this used to stop first and copy after, which kept the server down for the
  whole copy and started it against whatever had arrived. Now everything goes
  into $Root\.stage-<stamp> while the server runs, the box checks it there,
  and the stop is only as long as a few renames on one volume and a start.
  If the new server does not answer, the old files go back and this exits 1.

                                         any machine, with no server build
                                         here (see GAMEMODE ONLY below)
    .\Deploy-Server.ps1 -FromStore       the server build the commit records,
                                         out of the store on the box, and the
                                         gamemode, with no server build here
                                         (see FROM THE STORE below)

  GAMEMODE ONLY (#1089). Every run above needs this machine's fork build: the
  server files, the build's settings and the load order are all read from
  -Dist. A gamemode is not part of that build. It is a versioned artifact
  any machine makes byte for byte from a commit (#459). -GamemodeOnly sends
  that, from any machine, and reads nothing out of -Dist:
    - gamemode.js from the gamemode artifact, the build stamp made from that
      artifact (channel main), and Thornswood-Content.esp into plugins when
      its size is not the box's copy's (the rule the full deploy uses);
    - server-settings.json made on the box: the running server's own file,
      copied into the stage unchanged, and the swap reads it back with no key
      allowed to move.
  Before anything is sent it asks the box which server build it runs, and
  refuses unless the box's server-build.json is the record the commit holds
  (ServerBuild.ps1 says how the two are compared), so the gamemode comes from
  a commit whose recorded server build is the one running. A gamemode that
  needs a newer server build goes the full way, from a machine with the
  build. It sets no setting, so it takes none of -RequirePass, -Devs and
  -Playtesters, and a change to what Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 writes for live (the
  load order, the NPC, gear, reloot and damage settings, ServerSettings.ps1
  names them) goes the full way too. The notice, the stage, the check, the
  swap and -PutBack are the same as every other run. Patrick, 5 Oct: any
  machine may do it.

  FROM THE STORE (#459). Since #2467 every full deploy and every
  Publish-Server.ps1 keeps the server build it sends in the box's store,
  C:\Thornswood-Deploys\server, by name. -FromStore puts the one
  records\server-build.json names onto the live server from there, with the
  gamemode, from a machine with no engine build:
    - before anything is sent the box says which zip its store keeps for this
      record, its live record, port, join pass switch and load order; with no
      zip for the record it stops there. -ServerBuild <zip> sends one first
      (engine.yml's, held to the record here and by its bytes there);
    - the record, the gamemode and its stamp, and our plugins when they are
      not the box's bytes, go up into the stage as -GamemodeOnly sends them;
      the box takes the zip's files into the stage, held to the record
      (Expand-ThornswoodStoredServerBuild, ServerBuild.ps1), and the stage
      check holds every one again by the record's hashes;
    - the live server keeps its own settings, copied into the stage as they
      are, and its load order and start point, so no key moves at the swap,
      and an engine that reads light plugins another way than the running one
      is refused (ServerOrder.ps1, #1715). It takes none of -RequirePass,
      -Devs, -Playtesters and -DropPlugins.
  The notice, the swap and -PutBack are the same as every other run.

  THE LIVE SERVER KEEPS ITS OWN SETTINGS (#1221, #1222). A build whose
  server-settings.json is not the live server's (port 7777, not the dev voice
  port or name, not thornswoodServer dev, no npcSettings "default" key) is
  refused before anything is sent. The one that goes up is carried on the box
  into the running server's own, taking from the build only what
  Deploy-Gamemode.ps1 writes for live on purpose (ServerSettings.ps1 says
  which and why), and the swap reads it back before the start: any other key
  that is not what the server had puts the old files back.

  THE JOIN PASS AND THE ROLE LISTS CHANGE ONLY WHEN THIS RUN SAYS SO (#1223).
  thornswoodRequirePass, thornswoodDevs and thornswoodPlaytesters are never
  taken from the build, which kept whatever one machine was once given and
  sent it again on every deploy from there. -RequirePass on|off, -Devs and
  -Playtesters set them on the box, in the carry, the way
  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -RequirePass sets dev's; without them the live
  server keeps its own. A live server whose join pass switch is neither true
  nor false is refused until -RequirePass says which (#1319).

  EVERY SERVER FILE GOES, AND ONLY THE RECORDED BUILD (#1214). The binary,
  the JavaScript half the server runs and the rest the fork builds
  (ServerBuild.ps1) go up together with records\server-build.json, each held
  to it here and again in the stage on the box. One that is not the recorded
  build, or a server file the record does not list, stops the deploy before
  anything is sent. Until then only the binary went, so the box could run a
  binary of one build beside the JavaScript half of another.

  The files a deploy replaced stay in $Root\.prev-<stamp>, the newest two.
  -PutBack is the one command that puts the newest back: the same stop, renames,
  start and check, and if the old files do not answer either, what was running
  goes back in again. What it took out is kept in $Root\.undone-<stamp>.
  Swap.ps1 holds the blocks that do all of it on the box (issue #446).

    Patrick, 21 September, on the dev server: "Dev has no playtetser list so
    I can't tp like I can on main", and after the roster copy went in, "still
    can't tp says no list".

    THERE ARE TWO ROLE SOURCES AND THE WRITTEN ONE WINS FIRST. rolelist reads
    thornswoodDevs and thornswoodPlaytesters straight out of
    server-settings.json, and only if neither names anybody does it fall
    through to the Discord roster in private\door.json. The roster is the
    better source, because a playtester added in Discord is a playtester
    without anybody editing a file. It is also the one that depends on a
    folder existing on the VPS, on the door having fetched, and on an install
    not having deleted it, and every one of those has failed.

    So the owner gets a written line that depends on none of it. The refusal
    itself prints the number to put here: "Ask Patrick to add profile
    <id>". Neither list is a secret and neither has a default, so a server
    told nobody still has nobody.

  # None of it could reach the server, and the launcher downloads the plugins from
  # the server, so none of it could reach anybody's game either. The gamemode was
  # live and calling for records that were not in the file any client had.
  #
  # So the size is asked for as well as the name. Size and not a hash because this
  # is one remote call over ssh for the whole folder either way, and a hash of 60
  # plugins is 28MB of reading on a box that is also running the server; a plugin
  # whose contents changed and whose size did not is a case this can live with,
