  Deploy-Gamemode.ps1

  Puts gamemode.js into the built server and writes a server load order that
  actually lines up with the client's.

  The load order is the whole game here, so it is worth stating plainly.

  SkyMP turns a form id into a plugin plus a local id with plain arithmetic,
  fileIdx * 0x01000000 + shortFormId, where fileIdx is the position in
  server-settings.json. The client does NOT translate: remoteIdToLocalId passes
  anything below 0xff000000 straight to Game.getFormEx, and the client never
  calls Game.getFormFromFile, the one API that resolves by plugin name and
  handles light plugins. So the server's indices must equal the game's.

  Skyrim gives an ESL-flagged plugin no normal index at all, so listing one
  server-side shifts everything after it. Leaving them out is therefore exact,
  not a compromise, and it matches what the client already believes: its own
  loadOrderVerificationService enumerates with Game.getModCount, which skips
  light plugins by construction.

  A plugin that masters to a dropped one cannot load either, so those are pruned
  too, repeatedly until the list is closed. On this setup that costs exactly one
  plugin, MCMHelper.esp, which is menu glue the server has no use for.

  A plugin is light if its extension is .esl or its TES4 header carries flag
  0x200. The second case is the one that surprises people: TheNewGentleman.esp
  was a plain .esp carrying both the ESM and ESL flags.

  AN ENGINE THAT LOADS LIGHT PLUGINS (#1715) gives each one the game's own
  0xFE slot, its light index, instead of a full index, so nothing shifts and
  nothing is dropped or pruned. records\server-build.json says which engine
  this is ("lightPlugins": true, written by New-ServerBuildRecord.ps1 when the
  recorded fork can tell a light plugin from a full one). Then the list is
  every plugin the game loads, in the game's order: the five masters, the
  Skyrim.ccc plugins in Data (_ResourcePack.esl is light index 0), then the
  plugin list, and the order the server already runs is kept for each kind
  apart (ServerOrder.ps1 says how). A form id is then computed from a
  plugin's place among the full plugins, never its place in the list.

  -FullLoadOrder disables all of this and lists everything. The server will
  start, and form ids will be wrong for every plugin after the first ESL. It is
  here for narrowing down a load failure, not for playing on.

  This script does not stop the live server and does not talk to the VPS. It
  only writes into the local build tree. People who are on live are counted and
  warned by Deploy-Server.ps1 before that one stops anything (OnlineNow, the
  listen check, Request-Restart, and -Minutes / -Mode / -Why / -Now). That is
  the live half of issue #520. online.json carries a count and no names, so the
  warning says how many are on, not who.

  It does not post to #news. A gamemode change that goes live is announced when
  Ship.ps1 runs and calls Publish-Discord.ps1 on the release note. This script
  only prepares the build tree; Deploy-Server.ps1 carries it up, and Ship tells
  people. Issue #594.

      The NPCs, and how many of them the server simulates.

      man all at once group together, on top of players, enimes hit way to hard
      and have to much health or dont die at all".

      npcEnabled true with an empty npcSettings means the server simulates
      EVERY npc in the world, interior and exterior, because both spawn flags
      default to true in ScampServer. That is one shared world, which is the
      thing SkyMP is for, and it is also every bandit and every chicken in
      Skyrim being kept alive by one process.

        -Npcs off        none at all. The cleanest way to test a trade.
        -Npcs interior   only inside, so towns are alive and the roads are not.
        -Npcs all        the default, everything.

      Off is not a downgrade to the old multiplayer mod's behaviour: that
      was everybody getting their own private copy. Off is nobody getting one.

      What a blow is worth, in each direction.

      Patrick, 21 September, after playing it: "enimes hit way to hard and have
      to much health or dont die at all". Both halves are one class in the
      engine, DamageMultFormula, which is always in the chain.

      -HitsOnPeople    an NPC hitting a person. The engine's own default is 2,
                       applied when this file says nothing, which is what it
                       has always said. Nobody chose that doubling. 1 is the
                       blow the weapon is actually worth.
      -HitsOnNpcs      a person hitting an NPC. This direction was never
                       multiplied at all, and the formula under it reads the
                       weapon's base damage, the target's armour and the power,
                       block and sneak flags, and NOTHING about the person
                       swinging: no skill, no perks, no attackDamageMult. So a
                       giant keeps its full vanilla health and takes the number
                       printed on the sword, over and over. 2 is a starting
                       point and it is one number to turn.

      Both are read separately by the fork, so setting one does not discard the
      other. They are in server-settings.json, so they reach the dev server
      through Publish-Server -Channel dev and the live one through
      Deploy-Server, and neither needs a rebuild once the fork is built.

  WHICH VOICE SERVICE THIS SERVER TALKS TO, written every time rather than
  inherited.

  This file is READ BACK AND ADDED TO, not rewritten from nothing, so a key
  nobody sets here survives for ever once anything puts it in. On 20 September
  at 23:13 Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 was run against C:\Thornswood-Server, the
  LIVE folder, instead of the dev one. It set thornswoodVoicePort to 7789, the
  dev voice service, and left its own server-settings.json.before-<stamp> in
  the live folder as the only trace. The backup it made has no such key, which
  is how that was proved rather than guessed.

  FOR TWO DAYS THE LIVE SERVER THEN TALKED TO THE DEV VOICE SERVICE. Nothing
  said so. The live voice service on 7778 took every slash command from every
  person and queued it; the live game server drained 7789, which was empty and
  always would be. The panel's picks ride that queue, so pressing Confirm at
  the end of character creation said "Sent. The server is checking." and
  nothing ever came back. Found 22 September with 38 commands piled up on
  7778 and 0 on 7789, after Patrick could not finish a character.

  The mirror of this is the case Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 exists to prevent, and
  its own comment describes it: a dev server with no port set talks to the LIVE
  voice service and drains the live queues. Both directions are silent, and
  both are one wrong -Root away.

  So the live deploy asserts its own port the same way the dev deploy asserts
  its. Setting it beats defaulting to it: gamemode.js falls back to 7778 when
  the key is absent, but absent is not what goes wrong here, a wrong value is,
  and a fallback cannot correct a value that is present and wrong.

# WHAT YOU ARE WEARING STAYS ON. Measured 20 September, after Patrick rejoined

#
# The server refuses an equipment update outright in two places, and on a
# modded load order both of them fire constantly:
#
#   equipmentSlotCheckEnabled   the gear strip. ActionListener::OnUpdateEquipment
#                               ORs together the biped slot flags of everything
#                               worn and refuses the whole update the moment two
#                               items share one bit, then sends an UnequipItem
#                               for every item involved. Vanilla Skyrim already
#                               uses slots 44 to 47, and every cloak, scarf and
#                               backpack mod reaches for the same handful of
#                               free-looking ones. It is an anti-cheat against
#                               wearing five chest pieces and it costs far more
#                               than it earns here.
#   equipmentSpellCheckEnabled  a spell the server did not itself grant is
#                               refused and a RemoveSpell is sent back. Every
#                               spell learned from a tome in the world is one
#                               the server never saw, so it comes straight back
#                               off the hand.
#
# Both were made switchable in our own fork of the engine and both still default
# to true in WorldState.h:277-278, because the engine change was made and the
# last step, writing the setting, never was. So the switches have been there and
# have never once been thrown. This throws them.
#
# What is worn is saved by the engine, not by the gamemode: MpChangeForm carries
# an equipment field and MpChangeForms.cpp writes it to the world save. So
# equipment already persists across a session, on the one condition that the
# update was accepted in the first place. These two lines are that condition.
# The gamemode cannot do this job instead: EquipmentBinding has a Get and no
# Set, so the server can read what somebody is wearing and cannot write it.

  NOTHING IN THE WORLD COMES BACK, EXCEPT THE THINGS THAT GROW.

  Patrick, 21 September: "even the stuff in the containers that start in them
  should be once only and same wih on the ground so it doesnt respawn and isnt
  infinites (Except for the thigs that hang like the meats, garlic, elves ears,
  etc.)".

  The gamemode already refuses to hand over a weapon, a piece of armour, a tool
  or a coin that the world placed, and empties a container of those once. What it
  cannot do from inside is stop the ENGINE putting everything back an hour later.
  MpObjectReference::GetRelootTime returns an hour for CONT, an hour for anything
  espm::utils::IsItem calls an item, and an hour for FLOR and TREE. So a chest
  emptied of its bread refills with bread at teatime, for ever, and that is an
  infinite supply of everything the gamemode does NOT take out.

  RequestReloot returns early when the base type is in forbiddenReloot, so this
  is the switch and there is no other.

  WHICH TYPES, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT MADE THE EXCEPTION SAFE. Every
  harvestable this server knows about was looked up by record type on
  21 September, all 146 of them across the four tables in game\data\harvests.json:

      the hanging game     7 bases, every one FLOR
      plants and harvests  109 bases, 69 FLOR and 40 TREE
      crops                15 bases, 11 TREE and 4 FLOR
      fish                 15 bases, every one FLOR

  Not one of them is anything else. So FLOR and TREE are exactly the things
  Patrick wants to keep coming back, and everything he wants to stop is a
  different type. The exception is not a list of forms anybody has to maintain:
  it is the two types left out of the line below.

  The item types are the ones IsItem covers, which is what the engine itself
  reloots on an hour, written out here rather than inferred so that a reader can
  see what is in the list without reading espm.

  NO "default" KEY INSIDE npcSettings, EVER. It emptied both worlds.

  ScampServer.cpp reads npcSettings.default for the two flags, and then ALSO
  puts every key of npcSettings, "default" included, into the per-plugin map.
  WorldState::IsNpcAllowed walks that map looking for each key among the
  loaded plugin file names, and returns false the moment a key is not one. No
  plugin is called "default", so every NPC in every plugin was refused before
  its flags were ever read. Measured 28 September with the server binary
  itself (scam_native.node) over the Skyrim.esm and Update.esm form range:
  npcSettings {} loads 6015 actors, {"default": {both true}} loads 0,
  {"default": {interior only}} loads 0. Patrick, 28 September: "NPCs are
  actually not working right now for some reason and they should be".

  So the shape written here is one the engine reads the way it is meant:
    -Npcs all       {}, no overrides, which is every NPC everywhere
    -Npcs interior  one entry per plugin in this load order, inside only
                    (the same measurement: 2498 actors, all of them indoors)
    -Npcs off       {}, and npcEnabled false above does the work
  Every key has to be a file name exactly as the load order spells it,
  because one key that is not a loaded plugin refuses everything again.

# and the server agree from the first frame instead of arguing about it. The
# Whiterun gate this used to point at was the published SkyMP spawn, and it is
# still the fallback, but it is outdoors and half a world away from where the
# client actually starts.
#
# The form id is computed rather than written down. SkyMP resolves
# fileIdx * 0x01000000 + shortFormId, so a literal would rot the moment the
# load order moved. fileIdx is the plugin's place among the full plugins of
# this array: every plugin in it, until an engine that loads light plugins
# lists them too, and they take no full index (#1715).
