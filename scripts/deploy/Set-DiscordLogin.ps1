  Set-DiscordLogin.ps1

  Points the site at your Discord, which is what decides who gets in anywhere.

  There are three things it holds, and they do different jobs:

    Client id and secret   sign people in. Proves who somebody is.
    Bot token and guild id look them up in your server. Proves they are IN it,
                           and what roles they have there.
    Invite link            where to send somebody who is not.

  Without the bot token the site can still sign people in, but it cannot see
  roles, so it falls back to the hand written admin list and lets everybody
  else in as an ordinary member. With it, Discord roles decide everything:

    Owner, Dev                         admin on the site
    Moderator, Gamemaster, Loremaster,
      Content Creator, Playtester,
      Member                           allowed into the game
    Banned                             turned away everywhere

  Jarl of <hold> and Citizen of <hold> are in world and grant nothing. Somebody
  playing a Jarl still needs Member to get through the door.

  Which roles mean what lives in config.json on the VPS under "access", so it
  can be changed there without touching this.

  First time:

    .\Set-DiscordLogin.ps1 -ClientId 123... -GuildId 456... -Invite https://discord.gg/xxxx

  It asks for the client secret and the bot token at a prompt rather than
  taking them on the command line, so neither ends up in your history.

  A bot token given here goes into the bot's C:\Thornswood-Bot\bot.env.json as
  well as the site's config.json, through scripts\vps\Write-BotToken.ps1, the
  one writer of it, and the bot is restarted. To change only the token,
  Rotate-BotToken.ps1 is the shorter way.

  Later, to change one thing, pass just that thing. Anything you leave out is
  left as it is:

    .\Set-DiscordLogin.ps1 -Invite https://discord.gg/yyyy -NoSecrets

  The fallback admin list, for when Discord itself is having a bad day. Pass
  every id, not just the new one:

    .\Set-DiscordLogin.ps1 -Admin 615236910243119104 -NoSecrets

  Where to find each:
    Client id and secret  https://discord.com/developers/applications, OAuth2
    Bot token             same application, Bot, Reset Token
    Guild id              Discord, right click your server, Copy Server ID
                          (needs Developer Mode on in Discord's settings)
    Invite                Discord, Invite People, Edit invite link, never expire
