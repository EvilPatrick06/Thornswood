  Deploy-Release.ps1

  Puts one signed build Release on the dev server by its tag (#5180, the
  deploy gate verb that comes first, Patrick 31 Oct 2026). The deploy agent
  on the box does the work (C:\Thornswood-Agent\thornswood-agent.exe deploy):
  it downloads the Release, holds manifest.cat to launcher\app\Signature.cs
  for the signer the agent was built with and the files to the signed
  manifest, and puts the gamemode in by the reload Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1
  uses (Reload.ps1, #3196), so nobody is dropped. When the new gamemode does
  not load, or the server stops answering its health address after it, the
  previous one goes back and has to load again.

      .\scripts\deploy\Deploy-Release.ps1 -Tag build-20261101.12

  From a cloud thread, which has no ssh, the deploy gate runs it with main's
  script (scripts\vps\gate\verbs.json):

      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Deploy-Release -Tag build-20261101.12'

  A ROLLBACK is this with the Release before: the gamemode reloads to it the
  same way. Dev only: main waits on its own approval (#5181).

  WHAT IT LEAVES. The box's deploy record (data\thornswood-deploy.json,
  C:\Thornswood-Deploys\current\<part>.json and history.log, the shape
  Artifact.ps1 writes), the replaced files in the server folder's
  .prev-<stamp> (Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -PutBack puts them back), and the
  whole log as deploy-<tag>-<stamp>.log in the dev server's data folder,
  served on its resources port; the last line here names its address.

  WHAT IT NEEDS. The agent, installed by Install-DeployAgent (a gate verb).
  The Release is published by .github\workflows\gamemode-release.yml when a
  gamemode change reaches main. Reading a Release needs no token beyond the
  one the agent mints from the box admin App.

  Keep it ASCII: Windows PowerShell 5.1 at the far end reads what is sent as
  ANSI.
