  Install-Runner.ps1

  Puts a GitHub Actions runner on the VPS, so the build check runs on every
  pull request without paying for minutes. Run it from this machine; it
  does the remote half over ssh, the same way Install-Backup.ps1 does.

      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1              install the first one, or put it right
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1 -Number 3    the third, beside the others
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1 -Status      what is there and whether GitHub sees it
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1 -Remove      take it off the box and off GitHub
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1 -Lock        lock every runner on the box again,
                                                    touching no runner and no job, and
                                                    take off the old priority watchers
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1 -OffBox      a pull request runner on THIS machine,
                                                    not the VPS (#1306), run elevated
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1 -NetworkOnly -Number 4 -AllowHost pypi.org
                                                    the outbound firewall rules alone for
                                                    the fourth VPS runner's account (#2161)

  OFF THE BOX (-OffBox, issue #1306). build.yml sends a pull request to the
  label thornswood-pr, which no runner on the VPS carries, so code nobody has
  merged never runs beside the live server. -OffBox puts that runner on the
  machine this is run on (One, or a spare PC), in an elevated PowerShell, with
  no ssh at all: the same scripts the VPS gets run here instead. Its defaults
  are C:\Thornswood-RunnerPR, the account thornswood-pr, the runner name
  thornswood-pr-<computer> and the label thornswood-pr (-Number n puts the
  number on the end of each, the same as on the box). What changes from the box:
    - The account is shut out of every C:\Thornswood* folder, not only
      C:\Thornswood-*: on a developer machine the play build and the vault
      are C:\Thornswood and C:\Thornswood Vault, and neither has the hyphen
      (nor had C:\ThornswoodTemps&Worktrees, the worktrees until #2900).
      -AlsoDeny adds any other folder (another drive, say) to that list.
    - Defender keeps scanning the runner's folder unless -DefenderSkip is given.
      On the VPS the speed was worth it; on a machine people work on, a pull
      request's code is exactly what the scanner is for.
  Kept as on the box: an account in Users and nothing else with a password
  nobody sees, the runner's own folder locked to SYSTEM, Administrators and that
  account with nothing taken from C:\, the pinned runner zip, the service at
  normal priority, and the old priority tasks taken off. -Status, -Remove and
  -Lock take -OffBox too. -DryRunTo <file> writes the scripts it would run to
  that file and runs none of them, with a stand-in for every gh call, so
  tests\test-runner-offbox.ps1 can read them without touching an ACL, a
  service, an account or GitHub.

  NETWORK ONLY (-NetworkOnly, issue #2161). Patrick decided on 11 October 2026
  that the VPS runner accounts get the same outbound limit as an off-box
  runner. -NetworkOnly puts on THE NETWORK guard below and nothing else, for
  the one account -Number (or -Account) names: no account, service, runner,
  folder lock, read deny or Defender setting is touched, and no runner job is
  stopped. Without -OffBox it goes to the VPS over ssh like -Lock; with
  -OffBox it is this machine. It is the one mode that may name an account
  carrying the VPS label (full -OffBox still refuses it). -NetworkOnly -Status
  counts the rules, -NetworkOnly -Remove takes only that group off (the
  rollback), and -DryRunTo writes the script instead, as everywhere else.
  Fetch the lists again now and then the same way (run it again). An
  install on the box puts the same rules on in the same run, before the
  runner can take a job; until 27 Oct 2026 it put none on, and runner 4
  needed a -NetworkOnly run after its install (#3956).

  THE SIGNING RUNNER (#3312). A runner records\sign-runners.json lists signs
  release launchers (release.yml's VPS fallback), and its sign steps reach
  Microsoft as well as GitHub: the signing client from api.nuget.org, the
  token exchange, the signing service, the timestamp and a revocation check.
  The record's "reach" names each host with the Azure service tag whose
  published ranges hold it, and -NetworkOnly for such a runner lets those
  tags' ranges through as well, read from Microsoft's Service Tags file
  (its download page names the week's file, and the file must say it is the
  Public cloud). The box reads the file and resolves each host, as it reads
  GitHub's lists, and each host has to answer from inside its tag, or
  nothing is changed and the host is named: an address resolved once stops
  holding when a front door moves, a published list does not.
  Microsoft adds a range to that file at least a week before Azure uses it,
  so a -NetworkOnly run each week keeps every host reachable. What it does
  not do: a tag is a whole service's space (AzureCloud.westus2 is every
  address Azure has in that region), wider than the one host, as GitHub's
  actions list is. The install registers such a runner with the record's
  label too, the way a build runner gets its label.

  THE SIGNING RUNNER TAKES ONLY MAIN'S JOBS (#3889). A runner
  takes any job whose labels it all carries, and the labels come from the
  workflow file of the ref that runs, so a branch's own copy of a workflow
  could ask for the signing runner's labels and run there, whatever the
  workflows on main say (#3550 holds those). What such a job leaves in the
  runner's folder, its profile or its caches, the next sign job runs with.
  So a runner records\sign-runners.json lists gets a job-started hook,
  C:\ProgramData\Thornswood-RunnerHooks\job-started.ps1, which actions/runner
  runs first in every job, before any of the job's own steps
  (ACTIONS_RUNNER_HOOK_JOB_STARTED in its .env, read when its service
  starts). The hook lets a job through only when its
  repository is this one and its ref and its workflow's ref are both
  refs/heads/main. Those are the job's github context,
  which the runner writes over any env a workflow sets (actions/runner
  v2.337.0, Handlers\ScriptHandler.cs). Refusing ends the job: a failed hook
  is only a failed step, and a later step marked if: always() still runs
  (StepsRunner.cs), so the hook stops the Runner.Worker that started it, the
  job's own process, and the runner reports the job failed and takes the
  next one (Runner.Listener\JobDispatcher.cs). The hook's folder is SYSTEM's
  and Administrators' to change; every account may read it. The install
  writes the hook and the .env line before the service first starts, and
  -Lock writes both again for every signing runner on the box (and takes the
  line off any other runner, whose branch jobs it would refuse); a runner
  already running takes the line at its next start. Main alone, not v tags
  as well (#3930, Patrick, 27 Oct): a v tag push runs the tagged commit's
  own copy of a workflow, and a tag can be pushed on any commit, while
  release.yml now signs only in a run of main's own workflow and hands a
  tag push over to one, so no job a signing runner should take runs on a
  tag ref.

  WHAT A PULL REQUEST JOB MAY REACH (-OffBox, or -NetworkOnly for the network
  alone). Two guards, put on by the
  install and by -OffBox -Lock, taken off by -OffBox -Remove, shown by -Status
  and written out by -DryRunTo like everything else:
    - THE NETWORK. Outbound block rules in Windows Firewall, in a group of
      their own ('Thornswood PR runner <account>'), that match only programs
      running as the runner's account (-LocalUser, the account's SID) and
      cover every address except GitHub's (the web, api, git and actions
      lists of https://api.github.com/meta, fetched when it runs, on the
      machine the rules go on, #3312), loopback, and whatever -AllowHost
      names resolve to then. Windows Firewall puts a
      block rule above any allow rule, so "block everything, allow GitHub"
      cannot be two rules: the block rules ARE the complement of GitHub's
      ranges. What that does not do: it has no idea of host names (a rule is
      addresses; the actions list is broad Azure space shared with others);
      the lists change, so -OffBox -Lock fetches them again and puts the
      rules back (a new GitHub range is blocked until then, which fails
      closed); DNS questions go out through the DNS Client service, not the
      account, so a job can still ask a name server (a DNS tunnel is possible);
      a job that asks a service running as another account to fetch for it
      (BITS, say) is not this account's traffic. build.yml installs the pinned
      ruff from PyPI, which is not GitHub: that step fails closed unless
      -AllowHost pypi.org,files.pythonhosted.org is given (their addresses at
      that moment; a CDN moves them).
    - WHAT IT MAY READ outside C:\Thornswood*. A deny for the account on the
      root of every other fixed or removable drive, on every profile in
      C:\Users but its own and Default (Public included), and on
      C:\ProgramData\ssh and C:\ProgramData\Docker. Each deny sits on that one
      folder and is inherited below it; -Remove takes exactly those off. What
      that does not do: a child with inheritance switched off keeps its own
      rules; Windows, Program Files and the rest of ProgramData stay readable,
      as every account's are, because the tools a build needs live there;
      and the runner and its jobs are one account, so a job can read the
      runner's own .credentials (GitHub's design, the same on the VPS).

  WHY. Every run of .github\workflows\build.yml has failed in seconds since
  02:10 on 25 September, because GitHub's own runners are blocked on billing.
  Decided by Patrick on 25 September (issue #437): a runner on the VPS rather
  than paying for minutes. build.yml asks for [self-hosted, Windows,
  thornswood-vps], which is every runner this puts there and nothing else.

  SEVERAL OF THEM. A runner takes one job at a time. On 4 October the queue
  was an hour long: eleven checks waiting while one ran, because the lanes
  open pull requests in bursts (five in seven seconds at 17:46) and every
  merge to main runs the check again. Patrick added a second runner that
  evening and asked for more. -Number n puts the nth beside the others: its
  own folder, account and runner name, each with the number on the end
  (C:\Thornswood-Runner3, thornswood-runner3, thornswood-vps-3), and the
  same label, so GitHub hands a waiting job to whichever is free. 1 is the
  first, with the names it has always had. -Status and -Remove take -Number
  the same way; -Lock does every runner on the box.

  HOW MANY BUILD AT ONCE (#2994). More runners than the box's six cores can
  carry only slow every build down: with seven at once on 21 October each
  harness step took 34 to 39 minutes and the 40-minute limit cancelled
  builds that were passing. The heavy jobs ask for a second label,
  thornswood-build, which only the runners records\build-runners.json lists
  carry (1 and 2 since 22 Oct 2026, #3114). This install registers a listed runner with it;
  Set-BuildRunners.ps1 puts GitHub right for runners already there.

  BUILD RUNNERS ON ONE (Patrick, 26 Oct 2026). The pull request build's
  fallback (build-pr.yml, launcher-vps) needs nothing of the box, so it asks
  for thornswood-pr-build alone; main's (build.yml) stays on the box, which
  traces the gate (#3114, #3874). An -OffBox runner whose name
  records\pr-build-runners.json's offBox lists (thornswood-pr-one,
  thornswood-pr-one-2, ... on One) is registered with thornswood-pr-build
  too and takes them, on One's own cores. It never carries thornswood-build,
  which only ever means one of the box's build slots (#4010), nor
  thornswood-vps, so staff notices, the admin service, the release jobs and
  every other job that needs the box never reach it. Pass -AllowHost pypi.org,files.pythonhosted.org, or the build's
  ruff install fails closed (WHAT A PULL REQUEST JOB MAY REACH, above).
  -OffBox -Number n -Remove takes one off again.

  ON THE RUNNER DRIVE (#4048, #3861, Patrick's A on 27 Oct 2026). Off the box
  Defender scans each runner's folder (step 6), and a fresh runner's first
  build on One took 7 to 11 times the box's processor time for it. So One's
  runners live on the Dev Drive scripts\deploy\New-RunnerDrive.ps1 makes,
  where Defender scans in performance mode instead of not at all. When a
  volume labelled Thornswood Runners is there and -Root is not given, -OffBox
  puts the runner in <drive>:\Thornswood-RunnerPR<n>. Its account is shut
  out of the other runners' folders on that drive as on C:, the drive's own
  root is left out of the read denies (New-RunnerDrive.ps1 locks it), and
  the service starts by hand: the drive's startup task attaches the drive
  and then starts it. -OffBox refuses a -Root on any other drive. To move a
  runner there, one at a time, after preventing new assignments and draining
  the selected runner in an operator-approved maintenance window, run elevated:
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-Runner.ps1 -OffBox -Number 2 -Root R:\Thornswood-RunnerPR2 -Migrate -MaintenanceWindow -AllowHost pypi.org,files.pythonhosted.org
  Substitute the selected number and labelled drive; -Root names the explicit
  canonical destination, never a custom source folder.
  Or use Move-RunnersToDrive.ps1 to coordinate the selected cohort. Migration
  preserves the existing account SID and live profile; missing accounts or
  services need that coordinator's separate -Recover path. Source data is
  retained on failure, not automatically rolled back: resetting a password and
  replacing registration requires explicit service/registration repair.
  A busy read is not an atomic drain. -MaintenanceWindow confirms the operator
  has prevented new assignments for this runner, not merely checked idle once.

  WHAT IT DOES ON THE BOX, in order:
    1. Checks what the build check needs is there: pwsh, node, python and git
       on the machine PATH, MSBuild and the .NET Framework 4.8.1 reference
       assemblies the launcher's project files build with (#498; until
       15 Oct it checked the in-box csc, which builds nothing past C# 5), and
       WPF in Windows PowerShell. It installs none of them; it names the
       script that does.
    2. Makes a local account, thornswood-runner, that is in no group but
       Users. Its password is made on the box, handed to the service once and
       never printed, stored or sent anywhere.
    3. Denies that account every C:\Thornswood-* folder but its own and
       C:\Thornswood-Dumps (CRASH DUMPS, below), so a job cannot read the
       site's config, the bot's token or the backups, and cannot write into
       anything live. And locks its own folder to SYSTEM, Administrators and
       that account (below).
    4. Downloads a pinned actions/runner win-x64 zip (version + SHA-256
       hardcoded below, #1372), checked against that pin, and registers it as a
       service that runs as that account.
    5. Takes off the priority watcher task an older install left (NO
       PRIORITY TASK, below).
    6. Tells Windows Defender to skip the runner's own folder, so the few
       hundred processes a check starts are not each scanned on the way in.
    7. Writes the runner's .env so its jobs keep their temp files in its own
       folder (TEMP IN ITS OWN FOLDER, below).

  TEMP IN ITS OWN FOLDER (#3117). A job's TEMP and TMP were the runner
  account's own, C:\Users\thornswood-runnerN\AppData\Local\Temp, outside the
  folder step 6 has Defender skip and outside the job temp folder
  (_work\_temp) actions/runner empties for every job. Measured on the box on
  21 October 2026 with four builds running: the box at 80% CPU on average and
  99.7% at the top, Defender 15 to 31% of it, and 26,214 to 28,472 entries
  left in each build runner's temp folder, the oldest from 4 October. Each
  runner's .env (actions/runner reads it when its service starts) now sets
  TEMP and TMP to its _work\_temp, so what the tests write there is not
  scanned and is gone after the job. The install writes it before the
  service first starts; -Lock writes it for every runner on the box and says
  which runners take it only at their next start.

  It needs gh on this machine, signed in as somebody who can administer the
  repository (Patrick): the registration token comes from
  gh api -X POST repos/<repo>/actions/runners/registration-token. The token
  lasts an hour and is never printed.

  ITS OWN FOLDER TAKES NOTHING FROM C:\. A folder made under C:\ inherits
  Windows' rule that BUILTIN\Users may read it, and every service account on
  the box is in Users, every other runner's included. A runner's folder holds
  the credentials GitHub gave it (.runner, .credentials), so until 4 October
  the first runner's account could read the second's: the second's install
  shut its own account out of the first's folder, and nothing shut the first
  out of the second's, which did not exist when the first was installed. Now
  each runner's folder is locked the way #1105 locked the server folders:
  inheritance off, SYSTEM and Administrators Full Control, its own account
  Modify, and nobody else, which holds for runners added later as well.

  -LOCK puts that right on a box as it is, without replacing anything: for
  every runner service there, it locks the runner's folder, and shuts its
  account out of every C:\Thornswood-* folder but its own and Dumps, saying
  which it had to close, takes off a deny an earlier install put on Dumps
  for it, it takes off every priority watcher task left on the box, and it
  writes each runner's .env (TEMP IN ITS OWN FOLDER). No service is stopped
  and no job is touched. An install ends by doing the
  same for every runner, so adding one leaves all of them locked.

  CRASH DUMPS (#2127, #2488). Patrick decided on 11 October 2026 (#2127)
  that C:\Thornswood-Dumps is read by SYSTEM and Administrators only, and that
  LOCAL SERVICE and every local thornswood-runner* account may make and write
  files there and read nothing: Windows Error Reporting writes a crashing
  node.exe's dump there as the account that node ran as, a build's included.
  scripts\vps\Lock-VpsFolders.ps1 gives the folder those rules. Until 12
  October this script still put a full-control deny for each runner account
  on every C:\Thornswood-* folder, Dumps included, and a deny beats the write
  allow, so a build that crashed node left no dump: adding runners 5 and 6
  that day put the deny back on runners 1 to 4 (#2488). icacls /deny also
  takes away the account's own allow rules on that folder (measured 12
  October on a scratch folder), so the deny took the write with it. Now the
  folder is Lock-VpsFolders.ps1's alone on the VPS: the install, -Lock and
  the lock at the end of an install put no deny on it, take off the one an
  earlier install left there for a runner account and say so, and say when
  Users still reach it, which means Lock-VpsFolders.ps1 has not been run
  since. After a deny comes off, Lock-VpsFolders.ps1 is run again to give
  the write back.
  Off the box (-OffBox) nothing gives a pull request runner write there, so
  Dumps is shut to it like every other C:\Thornswood* folder.
  tests\test-runner-lock.ps1 holds it.

  NO PRIORITY TASK (#1969). Until 5 October each install registered a task,
  Thornswood Runner Priority (Thornswood Runner N Priority from the second
  on), that set Runner.Listener and Runner.Worker to Normal at start and
  every five minutes: a timer that repairs state, which Developer-Guide.md
  "Fix the cause, no band-aids" does not allow. Until 25 September it set
  them to BelowNormal, which is where they ran then; since then it had nothing
  to repair. The runner is a Windows service (config.cmd --runasservice),
  and the service control manager starts a service at Normal, I/O priority 2
  and memory priority 5; the runner sets no priority of its own on Windows
  (actions/runner lowers a job's processes only on Linux, through
  oom_score_adj, in ProcessInvoker.cs). On the VPS on 5 October the runners
  measured Normal, 2 and 5 (PR #1967), and the watcher could not have given
  them the 2 and the 5: its line changes the class only, so a program a
  priority 7 task started went from BelowNormal, I/O 1, memory 2 to Normal,
  1 and 2, measured the same day (tests\test-runner-priority.ps1). The
  install, -Lock and -Remove take every such task off the box and name it;
  -Status says when one is still there. A build shares the box's six cores
  at Normal with the site, Caddy and the bot, never above them. Since
  12 Oct 2026 the game servers and voice run High, above every build:
  Patrick's decision, "we need to fix it so the servers run on high
  priority" (#2491, Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 and Install-Voice.ps1).

  A REMOVED ACCOUNT'S PROFILE (#3119). Removing an account leaves its
  profile, C:\Users\<account>, and Windows gives a later account of the same
  name C:\Users\<account>.<computer> beside it. A runner's account is a
  service's, and Windows keeps a service account's registry loaded until the
  box restarts, even after the service stops and the account is gone; while
  it is loaded the profile cannot be taken off. Measured on the VPS on 22 Oct
  2026: removed runners 4 to 8 had their registry loaded hours later, with no
  logon session and nothing running as them, reg unload was refused, and
  stopping the Program Compatibility Assistant changed nothing; a new
  runner 3's registry was still loaded 60 seconds after its service stopped;
  the restart at 8:45 PM let go of every one. So -Remove, -Lock and the next
  install of that name take off each profile under a runner account's name
  whose account is gone, once Windows has let go of it, and say LEFT for one
  still loaded, until a restart. An install makes no new account while a
  profile of its name is LEFT, so it never makes a second one. Off-box, arrange
  an explicitly approved local PC restart on THIS machine, never a VPS script.
  In remote VPS mode only, restart the VPS with
  scripts\vps\Set-TimeWait.ps1 -Restart and run it again.

  Safe to run again. An existing runner is replaced, the account keeps its
  name and gets a new password, and the folder denials are made again.
  Replacing or removing one refuses while it is running a job, and touches nothing (#3889); -Lock does not stop jobs either.
