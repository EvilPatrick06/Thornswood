  Install-AdminService.ps1

  Puts the box's GitHub admin service on the VPS (#3107, Patrick's A of 22 Oct
  2026): scripts\vps\admin\admin.js, as the task "Thornswood Admin",
  listening on 127.0.0.1:7791. It holds the key of a GitHub App made for
  Thornswood, and makes the runners' labels on GitHub match main's runner
  records when a run of .github\workflows\github-admin.yml on main asks
  with its OIDC token (admin.js says how it checks that, and why nothing else
  may ask). That is how Set-BuildRunners.ps1 works from anywhere, a cloud
  thread included. Run it from a machine whose way in already works; it does
  the remote half over ssh, so a service that does not answer is put back as
  it was before this ends.

      .\scripts\deploy\Install-AdminService.ps1           install it, or the newest
                                                         commit of it, and start it
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-AdminService.ps1 -Setup    arm the App's one-time setup
                                                         and print its address
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-AdminService.ps1 -Status   what is there and its log
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-AdminService.ps1 -Forget   drop the App's key, for a new App
      .\scripts\deploy\Install-AdminService.ps1 -Remove   take it off again

  THE APP (once, by whoever owns the repository). -Setup writes
  state\setup.json, a state nobody can guess that lives an hour, and prints
  https://thornswood.net/github-app/setup?state=<it>. Caddy carries
  /github-app/ to the service (the handle_path block in
  scripts\deploy\Caddyfile, sent by Setup-Domain.ps1). Opening that address
  and pressing the button sends GitHub the App's manifest: private,
  "Administration: write" and "Contents: read", no webhook. GitHub makes the
  App and sends the browser back to /github-app/setup/done, where the service
  trades GitHub's one-time code for the App's key and keeps it in
  state\key.pem. The key is never shown, logged or copied. Last, install the
  App on Thornswood only, from the link the page gives. An App held already
  stops -Setup; -Forget drops it first (delete the old App on GitHub too:
  github.com/settings/apps).

  WHAT IT RUNS AS. LOCAL SERVICE, Limited, with a SID of its own, like the
  bridge and Caddy (#2578, ServiceAccount.ps1), after the same fail-safe. The
  folder takes nothing from C:\: SYSTEM, Administrators and whoever runs
  this, plus the task's own SID to read it, write its log and keep the App in
  state. No other service and no runner account can read the key
  (records\runner-isolation.json lists the folder, and
  scripts\vps\Check-RunnerIsolation.ps1 checks it). -AsSystem registers it as
  SYSTEM, Highest, the way back if LOCAL SERVICE cannot run it.

  WHAT IT SENDS. A commit or nothing (Artifact.ps1, #459, #1121): admin.js
  and Server-Log.js out of HEAD, checked against the commit
  (Assert-ThornswoodSourceIntegrity) before anything is sent. They go into
  -Root\.stage-<stamp>, are checked there by hash and node --check with the
  old service still running, and only then is it stopped and they are renamed
  in; what they replace goes to .prev-<stamp>. If the new one does not
  answer, the old files and the old task go back and are started. The state
  folder, and the App in it, are never touched by an install.

  THE LOG. admin.log, one line per request (what was asked, by which run,
  what changed), never a token or the key, written by server-log.js with a
  time on each line and kept for 90 days, the same as bridge.log.
