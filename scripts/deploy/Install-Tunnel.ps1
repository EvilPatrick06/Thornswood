  Install-Tunnel.ps1

  Puts the site behind a Cloudflare Tunnel (#5334): cloudflared runs on the
  box as the task "Thornswood Tunnel" and keeps an outbound connection open to
  Cloudflare, and Cloudflare sends thornswood.net and www down it to Caddy on
  127.0.0.1:443. Caddy stays the one door (scripts\deploy\Caddyfile), so every
  route, header and log is the same whichever way a request came in.

      pwsh scripts/deploy/Install-Tunnel.ps1            make the tunnel, write its routes, install
                                                        cloudflared and start it; DNS is not touched
      pwsh scripts/deploy/Install-Tunnel.ps1 -Switch    move thornswood.net and www onto the tunnel
      pwsh scripts/deploy/Install-Tunnel.ps1 -Back      put both names back on the box's address
      pwsh scripts/deploy/Install-Tunnel.ps1 -Status    what runs on the box; only reads
      pwsh scripts/deploy/Install-Tunnel.ps1 -Remove    take cloudflared off the box again

  From a cloud thread or the Desk, where box work goes only through the
  deploy gate (#2841), add -ThroughGate to any of them but -Remove:

      pwsh scripts/deploy/Install-Tunnel.ps1 -ThroughGate
      pwsh scripts/deploy/Install-Tunnel.ps1 -ThroughGate -Switch

  It asks the gate for the box's public seal key (the verb's -SealKey), has
  tunnel-token.yml seal the API token to it, and hands the gate the sealed
  form (-Sealed), so the gate runs this same script on the box, which opens
  it. Without -ThroughGate it runs from a machine with gh and the box's ssh.

  Run it from anywhere with gh and the box's ssh: a cloud thread, the Desk, a
  developer's PC. Everything it does is written down in
  records\cloudflare-tunnel.json: the account, the zone, the tunnel's name,
  the cloudflared release by SHA-256, its routes and the two DNS names with
  the box's address.

  FREE. Every Cloudflare account includes 1,000 tunnels at no cost, Tunnel is
  on every plan, and publishing a hostname needs only a domain on Cloudflare,
  which thornswood.net is (checked 1 Nov 2026, #5190:
  https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/features/tunnels-for-platforms/#pricing,
  https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/). No Cloudflare
  Access and no Zero Trust organization is used: those ask for card details.

  THE TOKENS. Two, and neither is ever typed into a session, printed, put in
  a file of this repository or put on a command line:
    - The API token. Patrick makes it once in the Cloudflare dashboard, with
      Account > Cloudflare Tunnel > Edit and Zone > DNS > Edit for
      thornswood.net only, the two permissions Cloudflare's own guide names
      (https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/), and pastes it
      into the Actions secrets of ThornswoodRP/Thornswood-Ops as
      CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_API_TOKEN, a page only he signs in to. Each run that
      needs it has the box print the public half of its seal key
      (scripts\vps\Seal.ps1), starts that repository's tunnel-token.yml with
      it, which runs this script with -SealOnGitHub and leaves only the
      sealed form as an annotation, and hands the sealed form to the box,
      which alone can open it. The box uses it for the calls below and keeps
      it nowhere: Set-Turnstile.ps1 -FromCloudflare does the same (#3216).
    - The tunnel's own token, which lets whoever holds it run the tunnel.
      The box asks Cloudflare for it with the API token and writes it to
      token.txt in the tunnel's folder, which only SYSTEM, Administrators,
      the account running this and the task's own SID can read. cloudflared
      reads it from there (--token-file, cloudflared 2025.4.0 and later,
      https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/reference/run-parameters/#token-file),
      so it is not on cloudflared's command line either, where the process
      list would show it (#451).

  WHAT A PLAIN RUN DOES, on the box, stopping at the first thing that is
  not right:
    1. finds the tunnel by its name, or makes it (config_src cloudflare, so
       its routes live at Cloudflare and change without a restart);
    2. writes the routes from the record and reads them back;
    3. asks for the tunnel's token and writes token.txt when it differs;
    4. downloads the recorded cloudflared when the one there is not it, and
       checks its SHA-256 before it is used;
    5. registers the task as LOCAL SERVICE, Limited, with a SID of its own
       (ServiceAccount.ps1, #2578), the way Caddy and the bridge run, and
       starts it;
    6. waits for cloudflared's /ready on 127.0.0.1:20241, which answers 200
       only while it holds a connection to Cloudflare, and asks Cloudflare
       whether the tunnel is healthy.
  When nothing differs and it is ready, nothing is stopped. DNS is not
  touched, so until -Switch nobody's request goes through the tunnel.

  -SWITCH moves the two names. Each must be one proxied A record at the
  box's address, or already the tunnel's CNAME; anything else stops it with
  what it found. Each A record is changed in place to a proxied CNAME at
  <tunnel id>.cfargotunnel.com, which the box's own requests to both names
  must then reach: cloudflared's request counter has to rise within -Wait
  seconds. When it does not, both records are put back as they were.
  -BACK changes them back to proxied A records at the box's address.
  Caddy's public 443 stays open behind Cloudflare's ranges
  (Set-WebFirewall.ps1) through all of this, so -Back is only DNS; closing
  80 and 443 is a later step of its own.

  WHY A RESTART WAITS FOR -BACK. Every ssh to the box goes through the
  bridge on thornswood.net/box/ (#2753), so once the names are on the
  tunnel, restarting cloudflared cuts the session that asked for it, as
  stopping the bridge did (#3214). A run that would restart it while the
  names are on the tunnel stops instead and says to run -Back first; a run
  that changes only the routes needs no restart and goes ahead.

  NOT HERE. The tunnel itself stays in the Cloudflare account after
  -Remove: deleting it is a step in the dashboard (Networking > Tunnels).
