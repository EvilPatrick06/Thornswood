  Rotate-BotToken.ps1

  Puts a new Discord bot token into both places on the VPS that use it, in one
  go, and restarts both programs that read it.

      .\scripts\deploy\Rotate-BotToken.ps1            asks for the new token, writes both, restarts both
      .\scripts\deploy\Rotate-BotToken.ps1 -Check     writes nothing: says whether each file holds a token

  The token lives in two files on the VPS:

    C:\Thornswood-Bot\bot.env.json    DISCORD_TOKEN     the bot logs in with it
    C:\Thornswood-Docs\config.json    discord.botToken  the site reads roles with it

  A token that reaches the first and not the second leaves the site unable to
  read anybody's roles, so everybody except the hand written admins is turned
  away. That is why this is one command: scripts\vps\Write-BotToken.ps1 writes
  both files or neither, and Install-Bot.ps1 and Set-DiscordLogin.ps1 use the
  same writer when they are given a token.

  Before running it: the Discord developer portal, the Thornswood application,
  Bot, Reset Token, Copy. The old token stops working the moment it is reset,
  so the bot drops off Discord until this has run. Pick a quiet moment: the
  restart throws anybody who is part way through a ticket.

  What it does:

    1. Asks for the new token at a prompt, hidden, never as a parameter and
       never as a word on a command line, and checks it looks like a bot token
       before anything leaves this machine.
    2. Sends the writer's text inline with the script that calls it, and the
       token on ssh's standard input after it, the same way Install-Bot.ps1
       and Set-DiscordLogin.ps1 do. Nothing is written on the box but the two
       files the token goes into (#3035: until 21 Oct 2026 the writer went up
       as a file of its own in C:\Windows\Temp first, and a run cut before
       the next call left it there).
    3. Writes both files, reads both back, and refuses a token for a different
       application than the one they hold (-AnyApplication, only when moving to
       a new application on purpose).
    4. Restarts the bot and the site, and prints what each said on the way up:
       who the bot logged in as, and whether the site can read the server.

  Every line it prints names a file and a state. The token is never printed.

  The old token is still inside every backup made before the rotation: the
  nightly ones in C:\Thornswood-Backup on the VPS, and any zip Fetch-Backups.ps1
  or Backup-Server.ps1 brought down to local\backups in the repository
  (Where.ps1 Backups; Downloads\Thornswood-Backups until 5 October). Discord
  stopped accepting it at the reset, but the same zips hold the client secret,
  which is still live, so they stay where the rest of that is kept.
