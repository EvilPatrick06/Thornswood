  ServerFolderTurn.ps1

  One turn at the game server folders, for the nightly backup and for the
  scripts that stop a game server and swap its files (#3247).

  Its text goes where StopAndMove.ps1's does for a game server: Swap.ps1 puts
  it in front of the game server swap block (Deploy-Server,
  Deploy-DevGamemode, and their -PutBack), Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1
  carries an exact copy, and so does vps-nightly-backup.ps1, which runs on its
  own on the box. tests\test-3247-server-folder-turn.ps1 fails when a copy
  and this file differ. It is not in StopAndMove.ps1, whose rule is that
  nothing in it sleeps or tries again (#2928): this waits for its turn, which
  is not a rename tried again. Keep it ASCII: Windows PowerShell 5.1 on the
  box reads a file with no byte order mark as ANSI.

# The server folders' turn (#3247). The nightly backup reads each game
# server's folder while it runs, and a server install or deploy stops that
# server and renames its folder or its files. On 22 Oct 2026 at 2:21 AM a dev
# publish stopped dev and was refused the folder swap ("Access to the path is
# denied"), because the backup, started 2:15 AM, still had files open under
# it: its log has game-dev\world taken from 2:19:33 to 2:22:00 AM, and the
# dev folders done at 2:27:01 AM. Nothing made the two take turns.
#
# So each takes the turn first: the backup for as long as it reads the server
# folders, an install or a deploy before it stops a server, held until the
# script ends. The turn is server-folders.turn in the backup's own folder
# (C:\Thornswood-Backup on the box, beside the server folders), opened with
# no sharing, so only one process at a time has it open, and Windows gives
# it back when that process ends however it ends: no turn is ever left taken
# by a run that died. Whoever has it writes who and since when beside it, in
# server-folders.turn.who, for the one waiting to say. With no backup folder
# beside the server folders (a scratch root in a harness, a box the backup
# was never installed on) there is nothing to take turns with, and it hands
# back $null.
#
# Hands back the open file, which the caller keeps until it is done; throws
# when the turn has not come in $WaitSeconds, naming who has it, so the
# caller refuses with nothing stopped. $Tell says the one line about waiting.
