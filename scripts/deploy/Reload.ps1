  Reload.ps1

  A dev gamemode deploy that changes only gamemode.js puts the new one in
  place while the dev server runs, and the server loads it there, with nobody
  dropped and every NPC still in the world (#3196, Patrick's C on 22 Oct
  2026). Dot-sourced by Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1, after Swap.ps1.

  WHY. Every dev gamemode deploy stopped and started the dev server, and a
  start is the whole server: measured on dev on 22 Oct, it is off for 6 to 10
  seconds, everybody on it is dropped and reconnects to a respawn, the NPC
  cast takes 3 min 50 s to load again, and the server is steady about 7
  minutes after the start. None of that is needed for a gamemode change. The
  engine has always watched gamemode.js and loaded it again when it changes
  (skymp5-server ts/index.ts, setupGamemode), and the gamemode is written for
  that: it clears its own timers and keeps what it holds on globalThis. What
  was missing was a way for a deploy to know the reload worked, so the
  deploys restarted.

  HOW IT KNOWS. The engine at Thornswood's fork from #3196 says after every
  load of the gamemode, in server.log:

      [thornswood] gamemode client scripts <digest> (<n>), changed since the last load
      [thornswood] gamemode did not load; the error is above

  and the gamemode says what it is as it loads (game/gamemode.js, gamemodeId):

      [thornswood] gamemode.js is git blob <sha1>, <size> bytes

  So the block below notes where server.log ends, puts the new files in, and
  reads what the log says after that place: the new blob and then the client
  scripts line is the new gamemode loaded; "did not load", or a load of any
  other blob, or nothing within $Wait seconds, is not. Then the old files go
  back the same way and the old blob has to load the same way. Only if that
  fails too is the server restarted, by the put-back swap (Swap.ps1) with
  those old files, which the caller runs.

  WHEN IT RELOADS, and otherwise the deploy restarts as before (the block
  says RELOAD NOT HERE, touching nothing, and why):
    - the run sends gamemode.js and the build stamp and nothing else: a
      plugin, a load order or a setting is read by the server only at a start
    - the staged server-settings.json is the running one byte for byte
    - the gamemode the server loads is $Root\gamemode.js
    - the engine on the box says how a load went (the line above is in its
      dist_back\skymp5-server.js)
    - the server is running: something holds its UDP port
  -Restart on Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 restarts anyway, and -PutBack always
  restarts.

  WHAT IT LEAVES. The files it replaces are copied into $Root\.prev-<stamp>
  first, gamemode.js, thornswood-build.json and server-settings.json, the same
  set a swap moves there, so -PutBack puts a reload back the way it puts back a
  swap. Each new file goes in with one File.Replace (ReplaceFile), the stamp
  first, so the gamemode the server loads is never half written and never
  absent. The newest two .prev and .undone folders are kept, as the swap keeps
  them.

  The people on the server are not warned: nobody is dropped. When the reload
  changed what their games run (a property or an event source the gamemode
  makes), the gamemode asks them to log in again, because the engine sends
  those to a game only when it logs in (game/gamemode.js, A RELOAD THAT
  CHANGED WHAT THE GAMES RUN).

  The block ends with one line the caller reads: RELOAD OK, RELOAD NOT HERE,
  RELOAD REFUSED (nothing was touched), RELOAD PUT BACK (the new one did not
  load and the old one is loaded again) or RELOAD FAILED (the old files are
  back on disk, kept in .prev, and the server did not load them either).

  Keep it ASCII: Windows PowerShell 5.1 at the far end reads the file Remote
  sends as ANSI. tests\test-3196-dev-reload.ps1 runs the block against a
  scratch folder with a stand-in engine.
