  Install-Bot.ps1

  Puts the Thornswood bot on the VPS and keeps it running. This is the one that
  stays up, unlike Setup-Discord.ps1 which builds the server once and exits.

      .\Install-Bot.ps1               all of it, asks for the token
      .\Install-Bot.ps1 -CodeOnly    just the code, then restart
      .\Install-Bot.ps1 -NoToken     everything except asking for it
      .\Install-Bot.ps1 -PutBack     the code the last run replaced goes back
                                     in, checked the same way
      .\Install-Bot.ps1 -SetPing     asks for the outside monitor's ping
                                     address, puts it in bot.env.json and
                                     restarts the bot; nothing else is sent

  What it does:

    1. Checks Python is on the VPS. If it is missing, downloads one pinned
       python.org 3.12 installer, checks its SHA-256, and installs it only
       when the file matches. A mismatch stops the run.
    2. Stages bot.py, card.py and the card artwork beside the running
       bot and checks them there, before anything is stopped (issue #446,
       FILES below).
    3. Installs discord.py and Pillow into py-libs beside the staged code,
       which the swap puts back with the code.
    4. Asks for the bot token at a prompt, never on a command line, and puts
       it in the bot's bot.env.json and the site's config.json together
       (scripts\vps\Write-BotToken.ps1, the one writer of it).
    5. Makes a shared key, gives it to both the bot and the site, so the site
       knows a ticket really came from the bot. The site is restarted when the
       key or the token changed, since it reads its config only on starting.
    6. Runs it as the Windows service ThornswoodBot, under its own account,
       NT SERVICE\ThornswoodBot, rather than as SYSTEM, and starts it by that
       name (issue #465, scripts\vps\Bot-Service.ps1 and BotService.cs). The
       service starts it at boot, starts python again when it exits, and
       rolls bot.log by size while it runs. The first full run takes the old
       scheduled task and its run.ps1 loop off the box.
    7. Leaves the bot's folder holding what it sends and what is the bot's
       own (its settings, its records and log in data, the service, the
       webhooks, the libraries), and nothing else: the swap moves anything
       else there, a file somebody copied in by hand, aside into .prev with
       what the new code replaced, and says each name (issue #1184,
       Get-ThornswoodBotOwned in scripts\vps\Bot-Service.ps1).
    8. Asks the box, once the swap has answered, what is really at the bot's
       folder there: one Test-Path line per file it sent, by full path, with
       data\bot.log among them. A file that is not there turns the run red,
       so a swap that said SWAP OK while something is missing from the
       install root cannot read as a good deploy.

  Run it again any time to push a change. It stops the old one by the
  service's name only once the new code has checked out, and puts the old
  code back if the new one does not come up.

  STAGED, CHECKED, THEN SWAPPED, issue #446.

  This used to copy every file straight over the running bot, without looking
  at a single scp exit code, and then restart it, so a copy that failed half
  way was loaded half new at the next start. Now the files go into
  $Root\.stage-<stamp> while the bot runs, every copy is checked, and the box
  checks the stage (each file by its hash, bot.py and card.py through Python's
  own parser). Nothing is stopped if that fails. The swap then stops the
  service by name, renames the files in (what they replace goes to
  $Root\.prev-<stamp>, the newest two kept, and so does anything in the
  folder this run did not send that is not the bot's own, issue #1184),
  starts it by name, and waits
  for this start to say it is watching its server. If it does not, the old
  files go back and the service is started again on them. -PutBack puts the
  newest .prev folder back the same way.

# Two things, both on every run. First the data folder, because the service
# opens its log before it starts python, so a folder that is not there, or
# that its account cannot write, is a service that does not start at all
# (Repair-ThornswoodBotData, scripts\vps\Bot-Service.ps1). Then data\bot.log,
# which is where the bot's log has gone since #1104: made empty when it is not
# there, whichever of the two files this run reads, so after a -CodeOnly run
# the path in the docs and in Show-BotLog.ps1 is a file that exists. It used
# to be skipped whenever the log beside the code was the one being read, which
# is every box that has had only -CodeOnly runs since #1104, because those
# leave the service program as it is and an older program writes the old
# place.
#
# Then the file this run reads, when that is the old place and it is not
# there either. Fresh opens it with FileMode.Open, which finds nothing to open
# and hands back no lines, so with nothing writing it Healthy waits out the
# whole of `$Wait, the swap puts the old code back, waits `$Wait again, and Why
# says 'nothing yet' about a file nobody had been told was missing.
#
# Making the newer file does not point the readers at it while the bot writes
# the older one: Get-ThornswoodBotLog takes the one written last when both are
# there, and `$log here was settled before any of this ran. The service opens

# then Test-Path on C:\Thornswood-Bot\data\bot.log and on
# C:\Thornswood-Bot\live-smoke-discord-export.json both answered False. Every
# line the run printed was about the box; the two answers were about whatever
# machine typed them, and C:\Thornswood-Bot is a folder on the VPS. Nothing
# in the run itself had ever said what those paths hold on the box, so there
# was no way to tell that apart from a swap that had left files behind, and
# the whole deploy was stopped for a day over it.
#
# So the run answers it. This asks the box, in one line per file, for the
# full path under the same root the swap moved the files to, and says which
# machine it asked. It also makes data\bot.log once more, after the start
# rather than before it: MakeLog in the hooks above makes it in front of the
# start, and this is the same two things again at the end, so a green run
# cannot finish with that path absent whatever the service did in between.
#
# A file that is not there turns the run red (FILES MISSING below), because a
# run that ends green while the bot has no export to read is the failure this
# whole block exists to stop.
#
# Single quoted and taking its values from the lines BotThereVars puts in
# front of it, like Swap.ps1's blocks, so what goes up is plain PowerShell a

# folder, with and without the export, while tests\test-deploy-swaps.ps1 reads
