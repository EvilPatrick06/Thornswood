make-join-card.py

Builds bot/assets/join-card.png, the picture every join card is drawn on, from
the Thornswood banner art in bot/.

One-shot generator; lives under scripts/oneoff/ so bot tooling sweeps do not
treat it as production bot code.

    python scripts/oneoff/make-join-card.py              writes bot/assets/join-card.png
    python scripts/oneoff/make-join-card.py --out FILE   writes FILE instead, to look at

Patrick, 24 September, with a tester's note "make it a Thornswood banner":
"the banner backgound needs changed to the thornswood". The card had been
drawn on a plain starfield with nothing of Thornswood in it.

Built from invite-splash-1920x1080.jpg rather than server-banner-960x540.png:
the two are the same picture, and the card is 1000 wide, so the 960 banner
would have to be scaled up and the 1920 one is scaled down. The wordmark sits
across the middle of the upper half and the name is drawn across the middle
of the card, so the crop is the landscape under the wordmark: the traveller
on the rock sits under the avatar, and the lake and the towns sit under the
name.

The art is far brighter and busier than the starfield was, so the area under
the words is darkened, and the ring round the avatar gets a darker patch to
sit on. card.render still lays its own wash over the text side, so what these
numbers are tuned for is what the words end up on, and
bot/test-join-card.py measures that against the starfield card, and runs this
script from scripts/oneoff/.
Only the background changes: card.py draws the same size, layout, fonts and
colours it always did.

Pillow only. Never connects to anything.
