  Reset-History.ps1

  Replaces the repository's git history with one commit, once (issue #567).
  Decided by Patrick on 25 September: "We can delete the repo history anyways
  just as a safe measure I want like nice clean orgaized state", and, asked
  how far, main made fresh and every old branch deleted.

      .\scripts\oneoff\Reset-History.ps1 -DryRun     says what it would do, changes nothing
      .\scripts\oneoff\Reset-History.ps1             does it, after you type RESET

  WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER. Every check comes before anything is changed.
    1. Stops unless gh is signed in, this checkout is on main and level with
       origin/main, nothing tracked is uncommitted, and no pull request is open.
    2. Writes the whole old history to a bundle file in your user folder,
       outside the repository. That file is the way back: git clone from it
       gives every old commit and branch. It holds exactly what GitHub held,
       so keep it private.
    3. Makes the new commits here with git commit-tree: one for main with
       main's tree exactly as it is, and one for hotfix/1.1.94-downgrade with
       that branch's tree, because live 1.1.94 was built from it and the next
       hotfix starts there. Nothing is merged or rebuilt; the files are the
       same files.
    4. Asks for RESET.
    5. Turns on force pushes for main, pushes the new main, and turns them off
       again whatever happens, then reads the setting back. Everything else in
       branch protection is written back as it was read.
    6. Pushes the new hotfix commit, deletes every other branch on GitHub, and
       turns on "Automatically delete head branches" so merged branches stop
       piling up (Developer-Guide.md, How work moves).
    7. Moves this checkout onto the new main. Your local branches are listed,
       not deleted: some may hold work that was never pushed.

  WHAT IT CANNOT DO. GitHub keeps every pull request's commits for good, and
  nobody can delete them, so the old commits stay reachable from the old pull
  request pages. What anybody clones is clean. The engine fork
  (EvilPatrick06/skymp) and Thornswood-Releases are other repositories and are
  not touched; the engine\skymp pin is part of the tree and stays.

  AFTER IT. Every other clone is on history that no longer exists. Each other
  developer runs, in their checkout, on main:
      git fetch origin --prune
      git reset --hard origin/main
  or clone again. Their engine\skymp submodule is unaffected.
