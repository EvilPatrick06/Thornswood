  Copy-ReleaseAssets-ToSite.ps1

  Puts every download the live feeds name onto the site, once, so launchers can
  be sent to thornswood.net for all of it and Thornswood-Releases can be
  retired (#897).

  WHAT IT DOES, for the main feed and the dev feed:

    1. reads the feed launchers read, https://thornswood.net/feed/version.json
       (and /feed-dev/), and lists every asset it names: the launcher, the
       client runtime, each pack and each optional pack, by sha256
    2. asks the site, with a HEAD request, which of them it already serves at
       /feed[-dev]/assets/<sha256>, and leaves those alone
    3. downloads each of the rest ONCE into a cache folder on this machine,
       from the other channel's folder on the site when it is there (no GitHub
       quota spent) and from the url the feed gives otherwise, and checks the
       bytes against the sha256 in the feed. A file that does not match is
       deleted and named, and never sent.
    4. sends the ones that matched with Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1 -Send, which
       puts each at <sha256>.part and renames it, and skips any already up
    5. asks the site again and says what is there

  WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never writes a version.json, here or on the site.
  Moving the urls is a publish's job: the next Ship on each channel, or
  .\scripts\release\Repair-Manifest.ps1 -MoveToSite followed by
  .\scripts\deploy\Remirror-Site-Feed.ps1, rewrites every url whose bytes the
  site answers for, and only those. Running it twice sends nothing the first
  run sent.

      .\scripts\oneoff\Copy-ReleaseAssets-ToSite.ps1 -Check    what it would copy
      .\scripts\oneoff\Copy-ReleaseAssets-ToSite.ps1           copy both channels
      .\scripts\oneoff\Copy-ReleaseAssets-ToSite.ps1 -Channel dev

  Measured 28 Sep 2026: 94 distinct assets across both feeds, 532,163,762
  bytes. The site already held 75 of main's 77 and 69 of dev's 93.

  Needs the VPS ssh key for the send (scripts\vps\Setup-SshKey.ps1 -Test); the
  reads are plain https. -SiteUrl and -SiteDir point it at a copy of the site
  on this machine, which is what tests\test-site-assets.ps1 does.
