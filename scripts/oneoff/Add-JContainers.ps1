  Add-JContainers.ps1

  RETIRED. DO NOT RUN. SunHelm left the collection with the needs rebuild
  (issue #480) and is in no live load order. Everything below installs
  JContainers SE and switches on the MCM recording that set SunHelm's
  hunger, thirst, exhaustion and cold meters on first character create.
  Running it now would put that SunHelm recorder path back into Game\Data
  for a mod the server does not carry. It refuses to run, and the rest of
  the file is kept for the history of how it was installed. site\data\known.md
  is where the removal is written down for people. Leftover after #735
  retired Add-TempleRespawn the same way.

  What it used to do, and what is left of it:

  Installs JContainers SE and switches on the MCM recording that sets
  everyone's survival meters up for them.

  SunHelm keeps its settings inside the save file, which is why the hunger,
  thirst, exhaustion and cold meters kept coming back off for whoever started
  a new character. Nothing shipped in a mod pack can reach a save. MCM
  Recorder can: it drives the real menu on the first character, clicking the
  options the way a person would. It needs JContainers to read its own files,
  which is the only reason this is a separate install.

      .\tools\Add-JContainers.ps1

  Options:
      -Notes "..."     what the News page says about this release
      -NoShip          install only, publish nothing

  The archive has to be JContainers SE 4.3.0, the one under Old files
  described as SKSE 2.2.6 / SSE (SAE) 1.6.1170. The current 4.3.2 is built
  for 1.7.104 and will not load here.
