  Undo-DiscordBuild.ps1

  Puts the Discord server back the way it was before a Setup-Discord.ps1 run,
  from Discord's own audit log: every change the bot made in the last few
  hours is read with its before value and reversed, newest first.

      .\scripts\oneoff\Undo-DiscordBuild.ps1            lists what it would undo, changes nothing
      .\scripts\oneoff\Undo-DiscordBuild.ps1 -Apply     undoes it

  WHY THIS EXISTS. On 25 September Patrick was told to run Setup-Discord.ps1
  only to make the #news webhook, which already existed. That script builds
  the whole server from bot\Build-Discord.py's plan, so it put back channels
  and a role the server had moved past, gave the bot overwrites on every
  channel and turned off Discord's join message. Nothing was deleted by it.

  What it reverses, and only when the bot's own account did it inside the
  window: a channel or role it made is deleted, a permission overwrite it
  made is removed, one it changed or removed is put back as it was, and a
  channel, role or server setting it changed gets its old values. Webhooks and
  messages are left alone. Anything else it finds is listed, not touched.

  The bot needs "View Audit Log" for this; without it the script says so and
  changes nothing.
