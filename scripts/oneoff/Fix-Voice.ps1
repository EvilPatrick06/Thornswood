  Fix-Voice.ps1 - get the voice service running on the VPS and keep it running.

  It was started with Start-Process -FilePath 'node', which needs node on the
  PATH of whatever session is doing the starting. An ssh session is not a login
  session and does not get the same PATH a desktop does, so 'node' resolved to
  nothing and the service never came up. The game server does not have this
  problem because it runs from a scheduled task with a full path.

  So this does the same for voice: find node properly, register a task, and
  have that task start at boot as well as now. And when it still will not start,
  print the reason instead of reporting a health check that never answered.
