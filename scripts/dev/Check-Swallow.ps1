      .\scripts\dev\Check-Swallow.ps1          compare with the baseline
      .\scripts\dev\Check-Swallow.ps1 -List    print today's numbers in the
                                         baseline's own format

  Counts the silent catches in the launcher and in the PowerShell under
  scripts\ and installer\, file by file, and fails when any file has more than
  scripts\dev\swallow-baseline.txt allows, or fewer than it allows with its
  line not yet lowered.

  THE SCRIPTS TOO, since #2711 (18 Oct). Until then this read launcher\app\*.cs
  and nothing else, so the two empty catches in
  scripts\release\New-ClientBuildRecord.ps1 that let a record be written over
  a base, dirty and stale check that never ran were never counted: no rule
  looked at a .ps1. PSScriptAnalyzer names them (PSAvoidUsingEmptyCatchBlock)
  in the build's lint step, which is warnings only and never fails. A script's
  key in the baseline is its path from the repository root, as
  scripts\release\Feed-Store.ps1; a launcher file's is its name, as Shell.cs.
  A PowerShell catch counts in the same shapes, with its type, or several
  types, in square brackets instead of round ones, as catch
  [System.IO.IOException] followed by braces with nothing but whitespace
  between them, on one line or across several. A body holding only a #
  comment does not count. tests\ is not read: a harness's catches are its own cleanup, and
  a check a harness hides fails the harness, not a release.

  THE SITE, VOICE AND THE BOT TOO, since #2736 (18 Oct). Until then nothing
  read a .js or a .py, so the /api/play/logs handler in site\server.js stored
  a session's logs, answered ok, and lost the session's trouble colour and
  the bot's crash note inside try { ... } catch (e) { } with nothing said.
  The JavaScript under site\ and voice\ and the Python under bot\ are read
  now, keyed by the path from the repository root like a script, as
  site\server.js or bot\bot.py. A JavaScript catch counts in the C# shapes,
  catch (e) and a bare catch, and so does a promise's .catch handed a
  function whose braces hold nothing but whitespace, as .catch(() => { })
  or .catch(function () { }), because that drops the failure the same way.
  A Python except counts when its whole body is pass: except Exception: pass
  on one line, or pass alone on the lines under it. A # comment on the
  except line, beside the pass or in the body says why, and does not count.
  Not read: node_modules (somebody else's packages), a .min.js (a vendored
  library, minified onto one line, such as site\public\marked-12.0.2.min.js),
  __pycache__ and a venv or .venv (the bot's installed packages), and the
  harnesses kept beside the code, test-*.js in voice\ and test-*.py in bot\,
  for the same reason tests\ is not read.

  WHY. Entry 239 on the To Do List. Measured on 24 Sep: 386 of the 618 catch
  clauses in launcher\app\*.cs had nothing between their braces, so a failure in
  any of them left no line anywhere. A tester says the Save button did
  nothing, and launcher.log cannot say why, because nothing was written. The
  entry counted 367, then 373, then 386 while it sat on the list, which is why
  this is a rule with a frozen baseline and not a clean up somebody has to
  remember.

  THE RULE is written out at the top of swallow-baseline.txt. In short: a
  catch counts when its body holds nothing but whitespace, on one line or
  across several, and a body holding only a comment does not count.

  WHEN IT FAILS. Put Swallow.Note("Class.Method", ex) in the new catch
  (launcher\app\Swallow.cs), which writes one line to launcher.log, touches no
  control and never throws. In a script, let the error stop the script, or
  catch it to say what could not be done and stop. If nothing should be done
  and nothing should be logged, say why in a comment inside the braces.
  Raising a number in the baseline is a decision for Patrick, not a fix.

  WHEN A NUMBER GOES DOWN this is red too, until that file's line in the
  baseline is lowered to what the file now holds. Issue #756. A fall used to
  print a yellow line and pass, which meant the lowering the rule asks for
  could be left for somebody else: Checks.cs and Verify.cs each sat a catch
  above their real count from #706 and #709 until the two lines were found by
  eye and lowered in #753. Red puts the lowering in the pull request that made
  the count fall, where it belongs, and the number cannot creep back up.
  Lowering a line is not a decision anybody has to take: the file already
  holds fewer, and -List prints the numbers in the baseline's own format.

  Read only. Exits 1 when any file rose, when a file fell and its line has not
  been lowered, or when the baseline cannot be read, and 0 otherwise.
  build.yml runs it on every pull request.
