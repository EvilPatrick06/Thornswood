.SYNOPSIS
  Writes scripts\README.md, the list of every PowerShell script under scripts\
  and the one line that says what each one is for.

.DESCRIPTION
  There were 128 scripts in tools and nothing listed them. Finding the one
  that does a job meant opening files until one of them said so, and only six
  of them had a help block Get-Help could read. Entry 260 on the To Do List:
  "a generated index at the top of the folder listing every script and its
  one-line purpose, regenerated in CI so it cannot drift".

  So the list is written from the scripts rather than by hand. A script's line
  is its .SYNOPSIS where it has one. Otherwise it is the first sentence of the
  comment at its top, after the line that only repeats the file name and
  after any usage lines indented under it, carried on into the next sentence
  when the first one is too short to say anything ("One command.", "Runs ON
  the VPS."). A script with no comment at its top gets a row that says so,
  and tests\test-script-index.ps1 fails on that row.

  Options are deliberately not in the list. Get-Help reads them off each
  script's param block, which is the only list of them that cannot fall
  behind, and a copy here would be one more that could.

  Read only apart from the one file it writes. It reads the scripts as text
  and never runs any of them.

.PARAMETER Check
  Writes nothing. Exits 1 when the index is missing or is not what this would
  write, and says which rows differ. The build check runs this through
  tests\test-script-index.ps1 on every pull request.

.PARAMETER Scripts
  The folder whose scripts are listed, every area under it but oneoff:
  scripts\, the folder above this one, unless a test points it at a copy.

.PARAMETER Out
  Where the index goes. README.md in that folder unless said otherwise.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\dev\New-ScriptIndex.ps1

  Writes scripts\README.md. Run it after adding a script or changing the first
  lines of one, and commit the file with the change.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\dev\New-ScriptIndex.ps1 -Check

  Says whether scripts\README.md is current, and exits 1 when it is not.
