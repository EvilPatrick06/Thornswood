  Start-Thornswood.ps1

  Launches the game the way the launcher's Play() does, without the launcher.

  Skyrim always reads its settings, plugin list and saves from two fixed folders
  under the Windows user profile. It has no concept of a per-build profile. The
  launcher works around that by moving those two folders aside and junctioning
  them onto C:\Thornswood\Profile for the length of a session, then putting
  them back. Launching skse64_loader.exe on its own skips all of that, so the
  game reads whatever plugin list is in the real Windows location, which is why
  QuickLoot could not find its own plugin: it genuinely was not loaded.

  Two details that are not optional:

  Working directory must be the game root. Address Library resolves
  Data\SKSE\Plugins\versionlib-*.bin relative to it, and EngineFixes fails hard
  with "Failed to locate an appropriate address library" when it is wrong, even
  though the file is sitting right there.

  The swap must be undone afterwards, including after a crash. Restore runs in a
  finally block and is safe to call when nothing is swapped, so a stale junction
  from a previous crash gets cleaned up on the next start rather than silently
  pointing a normal Skyrim launch at this build.

  mklink /J makes junctions, which do NOT need administrator. Only symlinks do.
