  Allow-Claude.ps1

  Adds the folders and the script paths a Claude working in this repo needs, to
  the Claude Code settings file, and reports exactly what it changed.

  WHY THIS EXISTS

  A Claude here can read the repo and run the read only scripts, and everything
  else it is asked to do it shows you instead. That is the arrangement in
  CLAUDE.md and it is not what this changes. What this changes is the two ways
  that arrangement breaks down into "I could not, ask Patrick" over things
  nobody meant to withhold:

    The fork is not in the repo. Our engine changes live in
    C:\Thornswood-Dev\skymp and the game we ship lives in C:\Thornswood. Both
    are outside the working directory, so reading a single line of either is
    refused. On 20 September that meant an engine defect could be found by
    reading the server log and then not checked against the source that caused
    it, and the fix for it could not be compiled.

    A compiler is not a script. The permission rules name whole script paths,
    which is why scripts\release\Build-Server.ps1 exists: one path to allow, rather than
    a bare msbuild line that no rule can sensibly describe.

  WHAT IT DOES NOT ADD

  Nothing that leaves this machine on its own: no Ship, no push, no
  Publish-Server, no Deploy to the live server, no Rotate-ServerPassword. Those
  stay yours to run, which is the point of that section of CLAUDE.md. The one
  exception already in your settings before this ran is Deploy-DevGamemode,
  which you put there yourself.

  Everything it adds is either read only or builds something on this machine.

  WHERE IT WRITES

  Your own settings, %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json, which is where the
  rules you already have live. -Project writes .claude\settings.json inside the
  repo instead, which would travel to Djinn's machine on a pull. That is a
  decision about somebody else's machine, so it is a switch and not the
  default.

  It never removes anything, it never reorders anything it did not add, and it
  keeps every other key in the file exactly as it was. It writes UTF-8 with no
  byte order mark, because a mark in a JSON file is how the dev server was
  taken down on 18 September and the same tools read this one.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\dev\Allow-Claude.ps1              add what is missing
    .\scripts\dev\Allow-Claude.ps1 -Check       say what is missing and change nothing
    .\scripts\dev\Allow-Claude.ps1 -Project     write the repo's settings instead
#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    # Say what would change and write nothing.
    [switch]$Check,
    # Write .claude\settings.json in the repo rather than your own settings.
    # That file travels on a pull, so it grants the same on Djinn's machine.
    [switch]$Project,
    # Also allow the scripts that reach the VPS and GitHub. OFF BY DEFAULT.
    # Asked for by Patrick on 21 September, in his own words: run it yourself so
    # you can, I want it all done when I wake up. It is a switch rather than the
    # default because CLAUDE.md says these are his to run, and a rule that grants
    # them should be something somebody typed on purpose.
    [switch]$Live,
    # Somewhere else entirely.
    [string]$SettingsPath = '',

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- what ------
#
# THE FOLDERS. Each one is the source of something this repo ships and none of
# them is inside the repo, so without these a Claude cannot read them at all.
#
#   the fork      our engine changes, on thornswood/engine-changes. Reading it
#                 is how an engine defect gets checked against the code that
#                 causes it instead of guessed at.
#   the game      what the launcher builds and what the table scripts read. The
#                 plant, ore and spell tables are read out of these records
#                 rather than typed from memory, and that only works if the
#                 records can be read.
#   the profile   launcher.log and plugins.txt. CLAUDE.md says to read
#                 launcher.log before claiming a cause, which needs this.

# THE SCRIPTS. The form matches the rules already in your file exactly:
# pwsh, no profile, -File, a repo relative path. A Claude will call them that
# way and no other, because a rule that does not match how it is called is a
# rule that does nothing.
#
# Two groups, and the difference matters:
#
#   READ ONLY. They look and they report. Check-LiveGamemode asks the VPS for a
#   hash and compares it. Check-Manifest, Check-Load and Check-Site ask and
#   report. None of them writes anything anywhere, here or there.
#
#   BUILDS ON THIS MACHINE. The three table scripts read the game's records and
#   write a json in the repo and a generated block in the gamemode. Build-Server
#   compiles the fork and writes the build record. All of it is local, all of it
#   is in git, and every one of them refuses to write anything when a check has
#   failed.
