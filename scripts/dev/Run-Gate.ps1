.SYNOPSIS
  Runs the gate harnesses for build.yml's gate: picks and splits them for its
  shares, on a pull request only those its change can reach, and runs a
  share's part (#3114, #5183).

.DESCRIPTION
  build.yml's gate job runs this and nothing else, once in each of its
  five shares, each on a hosted runner of its own (-Of says why), after its
  job "Pick the gate harnesses" ran it once to pick and split (-Pick):

      .\scripts\dev\Run-Gate.ps1 -Pick 5
      .\scripts\dev\Run-Gate.ps1 -Shard 1 -Of 5 -Throttle 6 -BudgetSeconds 1200

  By hand, with no -Of, it is the whole gate on this machine, as below.

  THE GATE. Every harness scripts\dev\Gate-Harnesses.ps1 lists, run through
  scripts\dev\Nightly-Harnesses.ps1 -Throttle at once with this build's
  share of the cores: the machine's cores over the builds it runs at once.
  On the box those are the runners records\build-runners.json lists, on One
  the off-box runners the runner records name for it (#3860), and on
  GitHub's hosted runner one.

  ON MAIN, ON THE VPS. Patrick chose on 22 Oct 2026 (option A on his page,
  q-3114-map-refresh) that every main build's gate is traced, so pull
  requests can be held to a map that is never more than a merge or two
  old. Only an administrator can start the trace, so this asks the trace
  task (scripts\dev\Trace-Gate-Task.ps1, which runs as SYSTEM) through the
  runner's own folder, <runner>\trace:
    tree.gz     every path in this commit's tree with its mode and object,
                so a pull request can measure its change from this tree
                without fetching it (Affected-Harnesses.js tree)
    ask.json    this run, its commit, its checkout and this process
    answer.json the task's answer: tracing, or why not
    starts.jsonl  Nightly-Harnesses.ps1 -StartLog, which process was which
                harness's
    done.json   the gate ended, and how
  A main build is never held up by it: no answer in -AnswerSeconds, or any
  answer but tracing, runs the gate untraced and that commit leaves no map.
  The gate is the whole gate either way; the trace only watches it.

  ON A PULL REQUEST, ON THE VPS. The task leaves the newest map in every
  build runner's <runner>\gate-map, a folder the runner's account may read
  and not change. Affected-Harnesses.js pick builds the map from it and
  measures the change from the traced tree to this checkout's HEAD,
  GitHub's merge of the pull request into main, and this runs only what
  that change can reach, printing why each one runs. Anything that goes
  wrong on the way (no map, a map that does not read, pick failing) runs
  the whole gate and says why; so does any change to the scripts that list,
  choose and run the harnesses.

  OFF THE BOX (#4009, #5183). A runner with no gate-map of its own (GitHub's
  hosted runner, where every build runs since #5119) takes main's newest
  nightly map, which .github\workflows\gate-map.yml traces on GitHub's
  Windows runner and keeps as an artifact, through scripts\dev\Gate-Map.ps1
  -Fetch, with the job's token in GATE_MAP_TOKEN, and picks from it the same
  way. The token is taken out of the environment here, before any harness
  starts, and put back only around that call (#4079). No map there either
  runs the whole gate.

  THE NOTE. It writes whole=true to the step's outputs only when every gate
  harness ran (with shares, when the pick's plan holds every one). Main's
  build skips (#3182, the job "tested") only a tree whose pull request ran
  the whole gate: scripts\dev\Tested-Tree.js counts a run's note only when
  every gate share's name says it was a share of the whole gate, and a
  share of what a change can reach says so in its name (build.yml). So a
  pull request that ran only what it reaches leaves main to run the whole
  gate, and the nightly runs it every night, so whatever a harness left out
  would have caught is still caught there.

  The trace task, the map's folders and how they are kept from the
  runners' accounts: scripts\dev\Trace-Gate-Task.ps1. Why a map is enough:
  scripts\dev\Affected-Harnesses.js. tests\test-3114-run-gate.ps1 holds
  all of this.

.PARAMETER Shard
  Which share of the gate this runs, from 1, with -Of: its part of the
  pick's plan, or with none, harness number n of the gate list (from 0)
  when n mod Of is Shard - 1, the way nightly.yml splits its harnesses. So
  every harness to run is in exactly one share.

.PARAMETER Of
  How many shares the gate is split into. build.yml's gate job passes the
  length of its matrix. With more than one no trace is asked for, and each
  share runs its part of the pick's plan.

  WHY SHARES (31 Oct 2026). Since #5119 nothing builds on the box, and
  every pull request ran the whole gate on one hosted runner's four cores:
  707 harnesses, 3741 s of processor, the gate step 18 to 20 minutes of a 21
  minute build (run 41231641217). Split five ways over five hosted runners,
  each share has about a fifth of that.

  SHARES OF WHAT A CHANGE REACHES (#5183). A share runs the part of the
  list build.yml's job "Pick the gate harnesses" (this, with -Pick) gave it
  in GATE_PLAN, and checks the plan first: made for this many shares, from
  this gate, each harness in one share. With no plan it runs its part of the
  whole gate by place in the list. It fetches no map itself.

.PARAMETER Pick
  How many shares to pick for. Runs no harness: on a pull request it picks
  what the change can reach from main's nightly map, as above, on main the
  whole gate; then splits the list into that many shares and writes the plan
  (plan=, shares=, whole=) to the step's outputs. With the map's seconds the
  split is by time, longest first to the share with least so far, so the
  shares end together (split by place, run 41260247002's took 175 to 327 s);
  with none, by place. One pick for every share, so all of them run their
  part of one list from one map: a share fetching for itself could read
  another map, a nightly trace having ended between them, or fail to fetch,
  and a harness would then run twice or in no share. A docs, site or bot
  change runs only the harnesses the map says read what it changed; none is
  skipped by its path alone, since many harnesses read docs.

.PARAMETER Throttle
  The most harnesses at once, as Nightly-Harnesses.ps1 takes it.

.PARAMETER BudgetSeconds
  As Nightly-Harnesses.ps1 takes it: a harness starts only when its whole
  clock still fits.

.PARAMETER AnswerSeconds
  How long a main build waits for the trace task to say it is tracing.

.PARAMETER StartLog
  Where Nightly-Harnesses.ps1 -StartLog writes which process was which
  harness's, for the ops repository's trace-gate.yml (#4013), the trace taken by hand
  (scripts\dev\Trace-Gate.ps1). A main build the trace task traces writes
  its own in <runner>\trace.

.PARAMETER Report
  A JUnit file for this share, as Nightly-Harnesses.ps1 -Report writes it:
  a test case for each check (#5295). build.yml's job "Gate report" merges
  every share's into one. A share with nothing to run writes one with no
  harnesses in it, so the merge still counts every share.

.PARAMETER Summary
  Where this run's checks go for a run's page, as Nightly-Harnesses.ps1
  -Summary writes them (#5295). The gate's shares leave that to the job
  "Gate report"; this is for a run of its own.
