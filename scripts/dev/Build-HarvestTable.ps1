  Build-HarvestTable.ps1

  Builds game\data\harvests.json: the table the server needs to say who may pick
  which plant. Nothing in it is typed from memory. It is read out of the
  plugins of this build on this machine.

  WHY THE SERVER CAN DO THIS AT ALL

  SkyMP already picks plants by itself. MpObjectReference::ProcessActivate
  treats a FLOR or TREE base record as pickable: it reads the produce out of
  the record, gives it to whoever activated it, marks the reference harvested
  and schedules its regrowth. The gamemode's mp.onActivate is asked first and
  returning false blocks it. So the gate for gathering is already in place for
  every plant in the game, and the one thing the server lacks is a list of
  which base records are plants and what each one is worth. This builds that
  list.

  WHICH SUBRECORD IS THE PRODUCE, AND HOW THAT WAS PROVED

  It is PFIG, four bytes, a form id. It was not guessed. Every subrecord of
  every FLOR and TREE record in Skyrim.esm was counted first, which gives
  FLOR: EDID OBND FULL MODL MODT MODS PNAM RNAM FNAM PFIG SNAM PFPC
  TREE: EDID OBND MODL MODT PFIG SNAM PFPC FULL CNAM
  Of the four-byte candidates, SNAM is shared by whole families of plants
  (every mushroom in the game carries the same one, so it is the harvest
  sound), RNAM and FULL resolve through the string table to text, PNAM is on
  all 86 FLOR records including the ones that yield nothing, and PFPC is four
  separate bytes reading 100,100,100,100 on plants that yield and 0,0,0,0 on
  the ones that do not, so it is the per-season chance. PFIG is the only one
  left, it is present on exactly the records that yield something (83 of 86
  FLOR, 32 of 154 TREE, and the 32 TREEs with a PFIG are the same 32 with a
  FULL), and resolving it lands on the right item every time:
      TreeFloraMountainFlower01Blue -> MountainFlower01Blue, Blue Mountain Flower
      TreeFloraWheat01              -> Wheat
      TreeFloraTundraCotton01       -> TundraCotton, Tundra Cotton
      FloraMushroom01               -> Mushroom01, Fly Amanita

  WHERE THE GOLD VALUE IS, AND HOW THAT WAS PROVED

  An INGR record carries DATA, eight bytes: the value as a uint32, then the
  weight as a float. Read that way the numbers come out as the prices these
  ingredients actually have (Blue Mountain Flower 2, Nightshade 8, Blisterwort
  12, White Cap 0, Chaurus Eggs 10) and the weights come out as 0.1, 0.2,
  0.25, 0.3 and 0.5, which is what they weigh. The other candidate, the uint32
  at the front of ENIT, reads 23 for a Thistle Branch that sells for 1, so it
  is not a price and is not used. An ALCH record is laid out the other way
  round: DATA is four bytes and is the weight on its own, and the value is the
  uint32 at the front of ENIT (Potato 1, Salmon Meat 3, Cabbage 2).

  WHAT A FARM CROP IS, AND WHY THE SERVER OWNS THE RULE AND NOT THE LOOK

  The second pass writes the farm crop table: the plants somebody works a plot
  of, rather than the ones anybody finds in the wild. It reads the same records
  the same way and sorts them by what was measured in the SkyMP fork at
  C:\Thornswood-Dev\skymp.

  MpObjectReference::Activate fires the gamemode's ActivateEvent first, and
  returning false from mp.onActivate blocks ProcessActivateNormal outright, so
  the server can refuse any pick. That is where a crop rule can live at all.

  MpObjectReference::GetRelootTime hardcodes std::chrono::hours(1) for FLOR and
  TREE, so the engine regrows a picked plant an hour later whatever the server
  thinks of it. That hour is the free endless farming this table exists to stop.

  The gamemode cannot set isHarvested and cannot set a reloot time on one
  reference. Neither is among the bindings in
  skymp5-server/cpp/addon/property_bindings/PropertyBindingFactory.cpp, so
  there is no call to make. The server therefore owns the RULE and the engine
  owns the LOOK: a crop the server still counts as growing is a plant standing
  there looking ready to pick, and all the server can do is refuse the pick and
  say why. That is why the grow times below start at the engine's own hour and
  never go under it: the rule must not call a crop ripe while the model is
  still the picked one. The state of a plot belongs on the reference itself,
  through mp.makeProperty and mp.set, which survives a restart in the world
  save; this script writes none of that and only says which bases are crops.

  A GATHERER GATHERS REAGENTS, AND FOOD IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S

  PATRICK, 21 SEPTEMBER: 'The farmer grows the crops? Those crops should be
  used to make food, why is a gatherer giving them all the food ingredients
  when they gather herbs and things.' And on the shape he wants: 'the farmer
  would supply the cook, gatherer would supply tailor and alchemist, miner
  smith, hunter tailor and smith and so on.'

  He is right and the table said otherwise. Measured in game\data\harvests.json on
  21 September, over the 131 rows of the harvests map, which is the gatherer's
  table: 106 of them produce an INGR, which is an alchemy reagent and is the
  gatherer's work exactly as he describes it. 24 produce an ALCH and 1 a MISC.
  Counted the same day over game\data\recipes.json, the gatherer supplied the Cook
  225 of that profession's inputs and the farmer supplied the Cook none at all,
  and the biggest of them were Butter 46, Leek 12, Potato 8, Cabbage 6, Carrot
  6, Gourd 4, Tomato 4, Ash Yam 4, Red Apple 4, Green Apple 4 and Pheasant
  Breast 4. A cabbage and a hanging pheasant were a gatherer's to pick.

  So the rule this script sorts by is written on the produce and not on the
  plant: A PLANT WHOSE PRODUCE IS AN ALCHEMY REAGENT IS THE GATHERER'S, AND A
  PLANT WHOSE PRODUCE IS FOOD IS NOT. Food is read off the record rather than
  off a list of names. An ALCH record's ENIT is the value in gold as a uint32
  and then a flag word, and bit 0x00000002 of that flag word is the food bit.
  That is proved in the header of scripts\dev\Build-RecipeTable.ps1 against the five
  masters, where the flag word takes exactly five values and every record
  carrying 0x00000002 is something eaten, and this script reads the same
  subrecord the same way rather than inventing a second test. Measured here on
  21 September: all 15 produce records the 24 food rows point at carry the food
  bit, from FoodCabbage to FoodCharredSkeeverMeat.

  WHERE THE FOOD GOES, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE RULE

  Taking food off the gatherer says nothing about whose it is, and a row that
  leaves one table and joins none is work that left the game. Every one of the
  24 goes somewhere and the run says which:

    A GROWN CROP IS THE FARMER'S, thirteen rows. Both apple trees and both
    apples again in JK's Whiterun's Outskirts, both carrots, the tomato, the
    ash yam, leek, potato, cabbage and gourd cluster. They join the crops map.

    HANGING GAME IS THE HUNTER'S, seven rows. HangingPheasant01 and 02,
    HangingRabbit01 and 02, the two giant-skewer charred skeevers and
    CharredSkeever03. They join a game map of their own, beside the fish,
    because the hunter's carcass table is built out of NPC_ records and a
    hanging pheasant is a FLOR somebody presses E on rather than an animal
    anybody killed.

    A PROP IS IN NO TABLE HERE, two rows. MammothCheese01 and BYOHButterChurn
    are neither a plant nor an animal, so no pass in this script writes them
    anywhere: they are left out and reported by name every run, the same way
    the planter sacks and the coin purses are. The cheese is nobody's, which is
    what Patrick asked for, and a base in no table falls through to the engine.
    The churn is the farmer's: Patrick, 21 September, "give milk and butter to
    farmers", so churn() in game\gamemode.js answers it with the farm verb as
    of 24 September, and Build-RecipeTable.ps1 reads that verb, so BUTTER, 46 OF
    THE COOK'S INPUTS, is a farmer's to supply.

    THE SOUL HUSK STAYS THE GATHERER'S, two rows, and it is the one judgement
    in the four. DLC01SoulHusk01 and 02 carry the food bit like the rest, so
    the rule alone would send them to the farmer. Two things were measured
    before that was refused. They grow in the Soul Cairn, a plane of Oblivion
    behind the Dawnguard questline, so nobody sows them and nothing bled for
    them, and a farmer's crop list with a plot in Oblivion on it is a worse
    answer than the one being fixed. And searched across game\data\recipes.json the
    same day, Soul Husk is an input to no recipe in this build at all, so the
    thing Patrick is complaining about, the gatherer handing the Cook their
    shopping list, does not touch it. It is named in FOOD_STAYS_THE_GATHERERS
    below and the run says so.

  WHICH PLANTS ARE CROPS, AND WHY THE RULE COULD ONLY BE WIDENED NOW

  A farm crop was a TREE record whose produce is an ALCH, and that record type
  test is gone. It was there because FLOR plus ALCH dragged in every meat rack,
  clam, cheese bowl and butter churn in the game, and it cost four crops: JKs
  Skyrim.esp and JK's Whiterun's Outskirts.esp ship FLOR copies of their apple
  and carrot beside the TREE ones, and the FLOR copies were left in the
  gatherer's table. A cabbage is a cabbage whichever record type it is.

  Every one of the things the old rule was guarding against now has a name and
  a home. The salmon and the clams are taken by the fish pass before this one
  runs. The meat racks are the seven game rows. The cheese bowl and the churn
  are the two props. So the crop rule is now the food rule with those three
  lists subtracted: a plant, of either record type, whose produce carries the
  food bit and which is not game, not a prop and not named as staying the
  gatherer's. On this build that is 13 records, and one field crop gives an
  INGR rather than a food, so no rule reaches it and it is named one at a
  time in CROP_BY_EDITOR_ID below: wheat. Tundra cotton (#626) stays the
  gatherer's, like the other flowers and mushrooms. 14 crops in all.

  The name in the table is the produce's name, the same as in the harvests
  table, because that is what somebody is handed. It is what the record says
  and not what the editor id suggests: XJKcarrotplant in JKs Skyrim.esp points
  its PFIG at the leek, so the table reads Leek. That is JK's own data and
  correcting it here would make the table disagree with what the pick gives.

  What it does, in order:
    - works out the load order: the five masters, then every plugin the
      reference plugin list enables
    - walks the FLOR and TREE top groups of each, in that order, so a plugin
      that overrides a plant wins over the one that defined it
    - keeps every record that carries a PFIG, and resolves that form id to the
      record it names, for its own name, its record type, its gold value and,
      when it is an ALCH, the food bit out of its ENIT flag word
    - takes the water produce out of them first, by the list of names in the
      fish knobs below, so the plant table never carries a record that is the
      fisher's work rather than the gatherer's
    - then takes the food out of them, by the food bit, and routes each row to
      the farmer, to the hunter's game table or to the excluded list, except
      the ones named as staying the gatherer's
    - then takes the farmyard out, by name (FARMYARD_BY_EDITOR_ID): a plant
      whose produce is a reagent and which is still the farmer's, the chicken
      nest (#628), which collectEgg() in game\gamemode.js answers
    - sorts each plant that is left into one of classes.md's four ranks by what
      its produce is worth (see the knobs below)
    - runs the crops pass over the rows it routed to the farmer, gives each one
      the rank the farm ladder names and a grow time worked out from the price
    - writes game\data\harvests.json, the crops, the fish and the game beside the
      harvests in it, and prints all four tables as JavaScript object literals,
      because the server ships as one file and cannot read the json

  THE FISHER'S RECORDS, AND WHY THEY NEEDED NO NEW ONES

  Skyrim's own fishing is a Creation Club system this build does not have, so
  the fisher's verb looked like a thing somebody had to place records for.
  Measured in game\data\harvests.json on 20 September, before any of this was
  written: sixteen records already standing in every river and on every shore
  are water produce, and every one of them was a row in the plant table, gated
  on the Gatherer. The salmon, the clams, the pearl oysters, the butchered
  horker on Solstheim and the slaughterfish egg nest. So the fisher's verb is
  the water that was already there, and the sixteenth, the clam at Oar's Rest
  whose produce is a fake coin worth nothing, is the one left out.

  Nothing on those records says water. They are FLOR records like a flower is
  and their produce is an ALCH or an INGR like a flower's is, so they are named
  one at a time in FISH_BY_EDITOR_ID below rather than found by a rule, and a
  name in that list that no plugin carries stops the run.

  Read only. It touches nothing in the game folder and nothing on the VPS, and
  it proves that by fingerprinting the game folder before and after and failing
  if anything moved.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\dev\Build-HarvestTable.ps1

    .\scripts\dev\Build-HarvestTable.ps1 -PluginList 'C:\Thornswood\Profile\OwnGame\plugins.txt'
    .\scripts\dev\Build-HarvestTable.ps1 -NoInstall

  Exit code 1 if a plugin in the load order is missing, if a localised plugin
  has no string table, if the stations file this server places its own bases
  from is missing or does not parse, if a plant's produce names no record in
  the build, if two plants land on the same key, if a crop has no produce or no
  price, if two crops land on the same key, if a record named as water produce
  is in no plugin in this build or has no Fisher rank set for it, if no water
  record is a novice's, if a record named as hanging game is in no plugin in
  this build or has no Hunter rank set for it, if no game record is a novice's,
  if a row the food rule routed to the farmer did not reach the crops table, if
  a food row is left in the gatherer's table without being named as staying
  there, if a name in FARMYARD_BY_EDITOR_ID is carried by no plant in this
  build, if the first rung of the gatherer's ladder or the farmer's is empty,
  or if the game folder changed underneath it.

# them 'takes an Advanced Gatherer'. workPerRank.advanced in the gamemode is 20
# pieces of work, so the only road onto the second rung was twenty cave
# mushrooms. A ceiling of 1g puts the 1g ingredients on the rung with them and
# leaves advanced the biggest rank, which is the shape classes.md asks for.
#   novice   up to 1g. 'The basics of your half, and not much of it.' 57 rows
#            of the 147 in the table: white cap, imp stool, namira's rot,

# ------------------------------------------------------ the food knobs ------
#
# THE RULE ITSELF IS NOT A KNOB. A plant whose produce is an alchemy reagent is
# the gatherer's and a plant whose produce is food is not, food is the ALCH
# food bit above, and that is read off the records every run. The whole of
# Patrick's 21 September correction is that one sentence and it is written out
# in the header. What is below is only WHERE each food row goes, because the
# rule can say a hanging pheasant is not a flower and it cannot say whose it is.
#
# All three lists are matched on the editor id exactly, the way the fish are and
# for the same reason: a record renamed out from under this is the quiet way a
# class loses half its work again, so every name in them is checked against the
# build and a name nothing carries stops the run.
#
# GAME_BY_EDITOR_ID: hanging game, which is the hunter's. Seven records on this
# build, read out of game\data\harvests.json on 21 September rather than listed from
# memory: every row in the harvests map whose produce carried the food bit and
# was an animal. Two pheasants hanging by the feet, two rabbits, two charred
# skeevers on a giant's skewer and a third charred skeever on its own.
#
# WHY THEY ARE NOT ROWS IN game\data\hunts.json, which was the other place they
# could have gone. That table is built by scripts\dev\Build-HuntTable.ps1 out of NPC_
# records and the death item levelled lists they point at, and loot() in the
# gamemode answers it only after reading the reference itself: mp.get type must
# say MpActor and mp.get isDead must say true. A hanging pheasant is a FLOR
# record standing in a hunter's camp. It is not an actor, it never died on this
# server and neither of those reads would ever answer for it, so a row in
# hunts.json would be a row nothing could reach.
#
# What they are is a press on a FLOR whose produce the engine hands over, which
# is the same shape as the water produce, and the fish pass on 20 September
# solved that problem once already: its own map in game\data\harvests.json, its own
# generated block in the gamemode, its own verb gated on its own class. This
# follows it line for line rather than inventing a second arrangement.

# GAME_RANK_BY_EDITOR_ID: which Hunter rank each of them asks for. INVENTED,
# and named one at a time rather than worked out, for the same reason the fish
# and the crops are. classes.md sets no number here. The gold rule that ranks a
# plant cannot rank these either: measured on 21 September, the three produce
# records are priced at 2, 3 and 4 gold, so every threshold in RANK_MAX_VALUE
# puts all seven on one rung and the ladder does nothing.
#
# So the measure is where the thing hangs, which is the only question a hunter's
# ladder can ask about a carcass somebody else strung up, and the editor ids say
# it plainly enough to rank on:
#
#   novice    the rabbits and the pheasants, four of the seven. They hang
#             outside farmhouses and at hunters' camps all over the province,
#             which is where a new hunter already is. THE FIRST RUNG CARRIES THE
#             MAJORITY AND NOTHING MOVES IT: an empty bottom rung is the circle
#             this repo has now been rewritten over three times, at the plants
#             where 33 of 50 novice rows were planter sacks, at the crops where
#             the gold rule put ten of eleven on one rung, and at the fish. A
#             hunter who cannot work a body cannot climb.
#   advanced  CharredSkeever03, the plain charred skeever, which is cooking in
#             bandit and forsworn camps rather than hanging at a farm.
#   expert    the two on GiantSkewer01, which is a giant's own spit, and the
#             giant is standing next to it.
#   master    nothing yet, left open on purpose the way the farm ladder's top
#             rung is. A record added here later lands on a rung somebody chose
#             rather than on the highest one by default.

# FOOD_PROP_BY_EDITOR_ID: food that is neither a plant anybody grows nor an

# here and both are furniture somebody put a FLOR on:
#   MammothCheese01  a bowl of mammoth cheese in a giant's camp. Nobody sowed
#                    it and nothing was hunted for it.
#   BYOHButterChurn  the churn in a HearthFires homestead. A churn is worked,
#                    not picked, so it is a station and not a crop.
# They are excluded and reported by name every run, and they go in the json's
# unranked list, the same way the planter sacks, the coin purses and the clam at

#
# THE CHURN IS THE FARMER'S, AND IT IS NOT THIS SCRIPT THAT SAYS SO. Counted over
# game\data\recipes.json on 21 September, Butter is 46 of the Cook's inputs, the
# single biggest of them, and this list left it with no producer. Patrick settled
# where it goes the same day: "give milk and butter to farmers". It still stays
# out of every table here, because a churn is not a crop and writing it into the
# crops map would make every churn in Skyrim a plot somebody sows. churn() in

# plane of Oblivion reached through the Dawnguard questline: nobody sows one,
# nothing bled for one, and a novice farmer's crop list with a plot in Oblivion
# on it is a worse answer than the one this change is fixing. And Soul Husk is
# an input to no recipe in this build at all, searched across game\data\recipes.json
# the same day, so the thing Patrick is correcting, the gatherer handing the

# it was ranked into the gatherer's table like a flower, and a gatherer pressing
# a nest in a farmyard was handed the egg the Cook's bread and pies ask for.
# A nest is kept, not found in the wild: it is the farmer's, the same way the
# churn and the living cow are. collectEgg() in game\gamemode.js answers it with
# the farm verb, and Build-RecipeTable.ps1 reads that verb, so Chicken's Egg is
# a farmer's to supply. It is not a crop either (nobody sows a nest), so it goes
# in the json's unranked list with the reason, the way the churn does, and in no

#
# ------------------------------------------------------ the crop knobs ------
#
# THERE IS NO CROP RULE OF ITS OWN ANY MORE, and that is the change of
# 21 September rather than something left undone.
#
# It was $CROP_RECORD_TYPE = 'TREE' and $CROP_PRODUCE_TYPE = 'ALCH': a farm crop
# was a TREE record whose produce was a food. The record type half of that was
# never about farming. It was a guard, and the comment that stood here said so:
# FLOR plus ALCH 'drags in every meat rack and clam in the game'. It cost four
# crops to do it. JKs Skyrim.esp and JK's Whiterun's Outskirts.esp each ship a
# FLOR copy of their apple and their carrot beside the TREE one, and measured on
# 21 September all four FLOR copies were sitting in the gatherer's table as wild
# plants. A cabbage is a cabbage whichever record type Bethesda or JK wrote it
# as, and a pass that can only see one of the two is guessing.
#
# The guard is not needed now because everything it was guarding against has a
# name and a home. The salmon and the clams are taken by the fish pass before
# this one runs. The meat racks are GAME_BY_EDITOR_ID. The cheese bowl and the
# butter churn are FOOD_PROP_BY_EDITOR_ID. So a crop is what the food rule at
# the top routed to the farmer: a plant of either record type whose produce
# carries the food bit and which is none of those three things. On this build
# that is 13 records where the old rule found 9.
#
# CROP_BY_EDITOR_ID: the crops the rule cannot reach. Wheat is grown in fields
# all over Skyrim and is a TREE record like the rest, but its produce is an INGR
# and not a food, so no rule written on the record types finds it. Naming one
# record is honest; widening the rule to INGR to catch it would take in every
# mountain flower, mushroom and hanging moss in the game, which is gathering and
# not farming. Tundra cotton used to sit here too; #626 moved it to gatherers
# (reagent flora with put-back), matching flowers and mushrooms. Matched on the
# editor id exactly, so the HearthFires planter BYOHHouseIngrdWheat01 is not
# caught by it.
$CROP_BY_EDITOR_ID = @('TreeFloraWheat01')
#
# CROP_NOT_A_PLOT_PREFIX: the HearthFires planters. These are Skyrim's own
# plant-and-grow system for a homestead garden: somebody puts a seed in the
# planter and the game grows it. They are TREE records and they give a MISC
# bundle, 'Cabbage (2)' or 'Nightshade (3)', which is a sack a Papyrus script
# turns into that many of the real thing. The server does not run Papyrus, so
# the sack would never open. They are not farm plots and are excluded by editor
# id prefix, which is 33 records on this build. The produce type rule already
# skips them, because a MISC is not an ALCH, but they are named here so that
# the reason is written down where somebody widening the rule will read it.
$CROP_NOT_A_PLOT_PREFIX = @('BYOHHouseFlora', 'BYOHHouseIngrd')
#
# CROP_GROW_MINUTES_*: how long a picked plot takes to come back. INVENTED, and
# the one real knob in this block. classes.md does not set it and nothing in
# the game files says it, so it is worked out from the one number the records
# already carry, the same number the ranks use: what the produce is worth.
#
#     minutes = BASE + produce value in gold * PER_GOLD, capped at MAX
#
# A cheap crop comes back fast and a dear one takes its time, so a plot of
# something worth having is worth waiting for. BASE is the engine's own hour
# and is a floor, not a guess: GetRelootTime hardcodes one hour for FLOR and
# TREE, the gamemode cannot change it and cannot set isHarvested, so an hour
# after a pick the plant looks ready whatever the server says. Anything under
# BASE would have the rule call a crop ripe while the model was still the
# picked one, and a grow time at or above BASE only ever means the plant looks
# ready a while before it is, which the server can explain when it refuses.
# MAX keeps one repriced ingredient in some future mod from putting a plot out
# of reach for a day.
#
# On this build the spread is nearly flat, because ten of the eleven crops give
# something the records price at one gold: ten at 75 minutes and wheat, at 5
# gold, at 135. It is worked out rather than typed so that a mod repricing a
# crop moves its grow time on its own, the same way it already moves its rank.
#
# CROP_RANK_BY_EDITOR_ID: which Farmer rank a crop asks for. INVENTED, and it
# deliberately does NOT use the gold value the rest of this script ranks by.
#
# PATRICK, 20 September: 'they cant grow them if they dont have the rank, they
# cant get the rank if they dont level up from growing them, they cant get the
# crops from anywhere so like how would do that'. He is right, and the gold rule
# is what made it a circle. RANK_MAX_VALUE ranks a plant by what its produce
# sells for, which is the GATHERER's ladder: it answers 'how valuable is this
# thing to find', and a rare flower deep in a cave should be worth more than one
# by the road. Applied to a farm it answers the wrong question entirely. Every
# one of the eleven crops produces something worth at least one gold, so every
# one of them came out Advanced, and a new Farmer is a Novice. Nothing to sow,
# so nothing to bring in, so no farming work, so no way to the Advanced they
# would need. The seeds handed out at creation were unplantable the day they
# arrived.
#
# So a crop is ranked by HOW HARD IT IS TO GROW, which is the only question a
# farm ladder should be asking, and that is a judgement and has to be written
# down rather than computed. The shape of it is the one classes.md publishes:
#
#   Novice    the common field crops. Cabbage, leek, potato, gourd, carrot.
#             These grow in rows outside every hold capital, they are in barrels
#             and on tables all over Skyrim, and a Novice can work them on their
#             first day. This is the rung the whole ladder stands on: unless a
#             beginner can both FIND and GROW something, farming cannot start.
#   Advanced  the ones that take a season. Wheat, ash yam, tomato.
#   Expert    the orchard. Apples, because a tree is the longest thing anybody
#             here plants.
#   Master    nothing yet. Left open on purpose for whatever is added next.
#
# A crop this list does not name falls back to the gold rule, so a mod adding a
# crop still gets a rank rather than an error, and the fallback is reported.
#
# THE SERVER DOES NOT READ THIS. game\gamemode.js carries its own CROP_RULES
# and that is what gates a plot, because the generated block in that file is
# overwritten by this script and a judgement written into it would be lost. This
# list exists so that game\data\harvests.json does not sit there stating a different
# rank from the one the server enforces. THE TWO MUST AGREE: change one, change
# the other, and the names on each rung are the same names in both.
#
# THE FOUR ADDED ON 21 SEPTEMBER are the FLOR copies the old record type rule
# could not see: XJKcarrotplantflora and XJKWOCarrotPlant are the same carrot as
# XJKcarrotplant and go on the same rung, and XJKWOTreeAppleRed and
# XJKWOTreeAppleGreen are the same orchard as the two JKs Skyrim apple trees and
# go on theirs. Every one of the four is already ranked exactly that way in
# CROP_RULES in game\gamemode.js, which is the list the server actually gates a
# plot on, so this is the two lists being made to agree rather than a new
# judgement: they were written there by hand when the pass could not reach them.

# It read 'every crop is a plant the harvests table already carries', because
# until Patrick's correction a cabbage was in both tables and a crop the plant
# table did not carry would have been a plot the gathering gate never saw. The
# whole of that change is that the gathering gate must not see a crop: a plant
# whose produce is food is not the gatherer's, so a crop leaving the plant table
# is the change working rather than a hole in it, and a check written the old
# way would fail on every one of the thirteen.
#
# What still has to hold is the other direction, and it is the one that catches
# a real fault: a crop whose produce is food must be OUT of the plant table, or
# a gatherer could pick a cabbage after all. Wheat gives an ingredient rather
# than a food, so the food rule never touches it and it is in both tables on
# purpose; it is the one named in CROP_BY_EDITOR_ID and the run says so by name
# rather than by a count. Tundra cotton (#626) is gatherer-only and must NOT be
# in the crops table.
