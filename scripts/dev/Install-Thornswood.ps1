  Install-Thornswood.ps1

  Everything the client needs, in one run, in the order it has to happen in.

  This replaces the sequence you have been typing by hand: the content plugin,
  the SkyMP client (the recorded build only, through Sync-Client.ps1), the
  creation menus, the body fix, the
  load order alignment, the gamemode, the preflight check and the launcher
  build. Each step names the files it must leave behind, and a step that exits
  cleanly without leaving them is treated as a failure, because those are the
  ones that reach five people before anybody notices.

  Nothing here starts a server or a game. When it finishes, press Play.

      .\Install-Thornswood.ps1              the lot
      .\Install-Thornswood.ps1 -SkipBody    leave the body meshes alone
      .\Install-Thornswood.ps1 -Only launcher,gamemode

  Step names for -Only and -Skip:
