Build-DoorTable.py

Walks every placed reference in the load order and writes down every door that
leads somewhere: which cell it stands in, which cell it opens into, which door it
is paired with, whether it is locked and by what key, and who Bethesda says owns
it.

WHY

The property system settled with Patrick on 21 September rests on one thing that
does not exist yet: the server has no idea what a door IS. Claiming happens at a
door, a deed names a building, a key fits a lock, a steward collects rent on a
property. Every one of those sentences needs the same table, and this repo has
never written a pass over placed references at all.

The entry on the To Do List says it in as many words: "The door table: a pass
over placed references giving every door, its building, its cell and the key its
lock wants. Nothing else can be built until this exists."

WHAT A BUILDING IS, and this is the one judgement in here.

A door with a teleport is a door between two cells. A building is the INTERIOR
cell you arrive in. So the building a door belongs to is the cell on the inside
end of it, and two front doors into the same interior are two doors of one
building, which is what makes a house with a back door one claim rather than two.
A door between two interiors, a cellar hatch or an inn's upstairs, belongs to the
interior it leads INTO by the same rule, and the pass records both ends so that
whoever builds the claim can decide how deep a building goes rather than having
that decided for them here.

WHAT IT READS. Nothing but the plugins. The five masters and then plugins.txt,
in load order, last one wins, which is the rule the game itself uses and the one
Build-RecipeTable settles overrides with.

THE PART THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE HERE BEFORE: placed references live inside
compressed records, and every other scanner in this repo skips those. A
compressed record is a four byte uncompressed length and then a zlib stream, and
zlib is two header bytes and raw deflate after them. Nothing about a door can be
learned without inflating them, so this does, and counts how many it could not.

WHAT IT WRITES. game\\data\\doors.json, and nothing else. It does not touch
gamemode.js: how much of this the server should carry is a decision that wants
the numbers in front of it, and the numbers are what this prints.

Read only apart from that one file.
