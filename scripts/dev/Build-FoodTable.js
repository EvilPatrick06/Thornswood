// Build-FoodTable.js
//
// Builds game\data\food.json: every ALCH record in the load order that somebody
// can eat or drink, what kind it is, and whether it is alcohol.
//
// WHY THERE IS ANYTHING TO BUILD
//
// Patrick, 23 September: "I also just ate food and my food percentage didn't
// change", and then "Water percentage doesn't change".
//
// Nothing was broken. The only thing that has ever fed anybody on this server
// is typing /eat: eating in the game is the client consuming an item in its
// own inventory, the server has no eat hook, and by the time the inventory
// sync arrives the food is simply gone, which looks exactly like dropping it.
// The client watches the equip event now, because in Skyrim eating is
// equipping, and tells the server WHAT was eaten. What it is worth has to be
// the server's answer, or a client could fill its own meters by saying so,
// and this table is that answer.
//
// WHAT COUNTS, MEASURED RATHER THAN TYPED
//
//   1. IT HAS TO BE FOOD. The ALCH record's ENIT flags carry the food bit,
//      which is Bethesda's own answer to "is this a meal or a medicine". A
//      potion of healing is not a meal and does not move a meter.
//
//   2. FOOD OR DRINK IS THE NAME, AND THAT IS A JUDGEMENT. Nothing on the
//      record says which: ale, water and a sweet roll are all food items with
//      the same flag. So the rule is the name, the list is written out below,
//      and anything not matching is food, because most food is food.
//
//   3. ALCOHOL IS ALSO THE NAME, for the same reason, and it matters more:
//      Patrick asked for alcohol to be thirst-quenching, hunger-making and
//      progressively worse with each one, so the server has to know which
//      drinks are drink.
//
//   4. ONE LINE PER RECORD, UNDER THE PLUGIN THAT MADE IT, WORTH WHAT THE
//      LAST PLUGIN SAYS. Djinn, 24 September: "if any drink is supposed to
//      satiate your thirst, any alcohol doesn't do this at all", with Thirst
//      at 0% and "You have eaten enough" on the screen. This used to key
//      every version of a record by the plugin it was read out of, so Ale
//      was three lines: 34c5e:Skyrim.esm reading food (its name is a strings
//      file number, so no word matched), 34c5e:Update.esm the same, and
//      34c5e:Gourmet.esp reading ale. An override keeps the form id of the
//      plugin that first made the record, so the game reports that ale as
//      34c5e of Skyrim.esm, the server found the food line, and the drink
//      filled hunger. The Gourmet.esp line could never be found at all.
//      So a record's high byte is read through the plugin's own MAST list,
//      the way Build-FireTable.js does it, and the version kept is the last
//      one in the load order, which is the one the game uses.
//
// Read only. It opens the plugins of the build and writes game\data\food.json.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts\dev\Build-FoodTable.js
//   node scripts\dev\Build-FoodTable.js --print
//   node scripts\dev\Build-FoodTable.js --plugins "C:\path\to\plugins.txt"
