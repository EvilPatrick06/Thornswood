Build-CastTable.py

Walks every placed actor in the load order and sorts the people into four:
traders, transport, guards and everyone else, hold by hold. It writes that down
as game\\data\\cast.json, which is the surviving cast written as a list before
anything is deleted.

WHY

Settled by Patrick on 17 September, entry 320 on the To Do List: "What
survives: traders you can buy from and sell to through the custom economy in
entry 214, and the carriage and ferry workers in entry 215. Everything else is
either rebuilt as a custom character or removed." And the order it has to
happen in: "Write the surviving cast down as a list before anything is deleted,
because the deletion is the part that cannot be undone".

This is that list, as a candidate. It removes nothing, changes no plugin and
touches nothing the server runs. A name on it is a question for Patrick, not an
instruction to anything. Guards get their own column because entry 321 wants
their numbers and they are neither a trader nor a stranger.

WHAT EACH COLUMN MEANS, and these are the judgements in here. Each was measured
against this load order on 24 September rather than assumed.

  trader     A member, at rank 0 or above, of a faction whose DATA flags carry
             the vendor bit (0x4000) and which has a buy and sell list (VEND).
             That is a vendor in the game's own terms, so it is the honest
             reading of "traders you can buy from and sell to". Rank -1 is not
             membership: Faendal sits in CurrentFollowerFaction, which has the
             vendor bit, at rank -1, and does not trade. The Job factions
             (JobMerchantFaction and the rest) are NOT the test: Belethor is in
             JobMerchantFaction at rank -1, so a job faction says what Bethesda
             meant someone to be and nothing about whether they sell. Of 1,620
             factions, 1,532 carry a VENV subrecord, so its presence means
             nothing either. 383 have the vendor bit, and the one of those with
             no buy and sell list is WhiterunBanneredMareFaction, which is who
             owns the inn rather than a shop. Hulda sells through
             ServicesWhiterunBanneredMare.

  transport  A member of a carriage or ferry faction, or one of the two
             records of Gjalund Salt-Sage, the Solstheim ferry, who belongs to
             no faction at all. The factions are the vanilla carriage system,
             the Hearthfire and Dawnguard drivers and ferrymen, and the ones
             CFTO.esp adds. CFTO also switches the vanilla drivers off, by
             their own flag or an enable parent, and places its own copies,
             which is why a driver can show up twice, once standing and once
             switched off.

  guard      A member of any GuardFaction<town>, or of IsGuardFaction together
             with GuardDialogueFaction, or of Raven Rock's guard faction.
             IsGuardFaction on its own is not the test: 50 people standing in
             the world are in it with neither of the others, and they are the
             Companions, the orc strongholds and a few soldiers, told to
             answer a crime rather than hired to keep the peace. Civil War
             soldiers in a camp carry CWSoldierNoGuardDialogueFaction and are
             not the watch of a hold.

  everyone   Every other person. A person is an actor whose race carries the
  else       ActorTypeNPC keyword. Wolves, horses, draugr and dragons are
             placed actors too and are counted, not listed. Mannequins are
             ManakinRace, which carries ActorTypeNPC, and are counted with the
             creatures because nobody would call one a person.

A TEMPLATE IS FOLLOWED, because a placed bandit or guard is usually a thin
record whose race, factions and name come from a template, and the thin
record's own RNAM is a leftover: 6,521 placements say FoxRace on their own
record. Each trait is read through the template the ACBS flags say to use, and
a leveled list is read through its first entry.

SWITCHED OFF AT THE START. A placement flagged initially disabled, or whose
enable parent is, stands nowhere until a script switches it on. 2,548 of the
6,931 people are, and most of them through a parent: the Civil War's other
garrison, a Hearthfire house not built yet, the vanilla carriage drivers CFTO
replaced. They are counted apart and, for traders and transport, named apart,
so the cast is the people actually standing there.

WHICH HOLD. The first of these that answers: the location the placement itself
carries (XLCN on the ACHR), the location of the cell it stands in, the
location of the ground under it when it stands in a worldspace's persistent
cell (by its position, 4096 units to a cell), the nearest ground within
NEAREST cells that names a place, and last the hold its crime faction belongs
to. A location answers when walking up its parents reaches one carrying
LocTypeHold, which in this load order is the nine holds and Solstheim. Anybody
none of these place is under "no hold", which is mostly holding cells, test
cells, Sovngarde and the arenas mods build in worlds of their own.

WHAT IT READS. Nothing but the plugins, the five masters then plugins.txt,
last one wins, the same reader Build-DoorTable.py uses. A plugin that names
its master as Hearthfires.esm and one that names it HearthFires.esm mean the
same file, so masters are matched to the load order without case: without
that, CFTO's override of a Hearthfire carriage driver reads as a second
driver.

WHAT IT WRITES. game\\data\\cast.json, and nothing else.
