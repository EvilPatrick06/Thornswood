  Build-RecipeTable.ps1

  Builds game\data\recipes.json: the table the server needs to answer "may this
  person make this". Nothing in it is typed from memory. It is read out of the
  plugins of the build on this machine, and every judgement it makes is in the
  knob block at the top of this file rather than buried in the code.

  WHY THE SERVER CAN DO THIS AT ALL, MEASURED IN THE FORK RATHER THAN ASSUMED

  It was believed here that the server could not see crafting. It can, and this
  was read in C:\Thornswood-Dev\skymp on 20 September rather than remembered.

  skymp5-server/cpp/server_guest_lib/CraftService.cpp is the whole path. A
  client asks to craft; OnCraftItem looks the workbench reference up, reads the
  workbench base record's keywords with GetKeywordIds, and calls FindRecipe.
  FindRecipe walks every COBJ in the load order (GetDistinctRecordsByType
  "COBJ"), keeps the ones whose inputs and output match what was asked for, and
  then ConsiderRecipeCandidate refuses any whose BNAM is not one of the
  workbench's keywords. What survives goes to UseCraftRecipe, which builds a
  CraftEvent and fires it.

  gamemode_events/CraftEvent.cpp: GetName returns "onCraft" and
  GetArgumentsJsonArray sends four numbers, in this order:
      actorFormId, craftedItemBaseId, count, recipeId
  recipeId is the COBJ's own form id, mapped to the combined load order.

  THE FOURTH ARGUMENT IS A NUMBER AND THE KEY OF THIS TABLE IS A STRING

  This is the one thing that has to be right for the gate to work at all, and
  the header of this script said the wrong thing about it until 20 September.

  CraftEvent::GetArgumentsJsonArray writes std::to_string(recipeId), and
  CraftService.cpp builds that recipeId as
  espm::utils::GetMappedId(recipeUsed->GetId(), *mapping). It is a uint32 and
  it reaches the gamemode as a plain JavaScript number, 1006945 and the like.

  Every key in this table, and in the RECIPES_BY_ID block, is a desc string:
  the form id in lower case hex, a colon, and the file the record belongs to.
  "f61:Skyrim.esm", "8a4:Gourmet.esp". That is the form the rest of this repo
  keys everything by, and it is the only form that survives a load order
  changing underneath it, which is why the table is written that way and not
  as numbers.

  So a gamemode CANNOT write RECIPES_BY_ID[recipeId]. That is undefined for
  every row in the table, onCraft never returns false, and every profession
  quietly makes everything with no error anywhere to say so. It has to convert
  first, with the function the gamemode already uses elsewhere:

      var row = RECIPES_BY_ID[mp.getDescFromId(recipeId)];

  The other generated tables in the gamemode do not need this line because
  their call sites already hold a desc: the harvest gate reads
  mp.get(refrId, 'baseDesc') and the ore gate goes the other way with
  mp.getIdFromDesc. onCraft is the one event that hands over a bare number, so
  the conversion is written into the json's "event" field and into the block
  comment rather than left for somebody to work out.

  gamemode_events/GameModeEvent.cpp: Fire asks every listener, and if any one
  of them answered false it calls OnFireBlocked and returns false. Only when
  nobody blocked does it call OnFireSuccess. CraftEvent::OnFireSuccess is the
  method that does the work:
      actor->RemoveItems(entries);
      actor->AddItem(craftedItemBaseId, count);
  So a gamemode whose mp.onCraft returns false REFUSES the craft outright. The
  inputs are never taken and the output is never given. The person keeps their
  materials. That is the gate this table feeds.

  ONE THING THE SERVER NEVER SEES, AND IT MATTERS FOR THE COUNTS BELOW

  CraftService::RecipeItemsMatch opens with an early refusal:
      enum { ArmorTable = 0xadb78, SharpeningWheel = 0x88108 };
      const bool isTemper = recipeData.benchKeywordId == ArmorTable ||
        recipeData.benchKeywordId == SharpeningWheel;
      if (isTemper) { return false; }
  Tempering is thrown out before any recipe is considered, so onCraft never
  fires for a recipe on the armour table or the sharpening wheel. On this build
  that is 1720 of the 5116 recipes. They are still in this table, with their
  owner, and every row carries a "fires" field saying whether the server will
  ever be asked about it. Only the rows that fire are written into the gamemode
  block, because a row the server is never asked about is dead weight in a file
  that ships as one piece.

  WHICH SUBRECORD IS WHICH, AND HOW THAT WAS PROVED

  Counted first, the way Build-HarvestTable.ps1 worked out PFIG: every
  subrecord of every COBJ in Skyrim.esm, 601 records.

      EDID  601  text, 16 to 46 bytes
      COCT  599  4 bytes
      CNTO  952  8 bytes
      CTDA  931  32 bytes
      CNAM  594  4 bytes
      BNAM  601  4 bytes
      NAM1  601  2 bytes

  Then reasoned about, then proved one at a time by resolving each and checking
  the answer makes sense.

    EDID is the editor id. Text, and it reads as text.

    COCT and CNTO go together. Over the five Bethesda masters COCT adds up to
    2619 and there are exactly 2619 CNTO subrecords. So COCT is a count of the
    CNTO subrecords that follow it, and CNTO is one input: eight bytes, a form
    id then a count. RecipeLeatherFoxHide has COCT 1 and one CNTO, which is the
    one fox pelt it wants.

    CNAM and BNAM are both four bytes and both a form id, and telling them
    apart is the whole job. Resolved across the five masters:
      BNAM lands on a KYWD record every single time, and there are only a
      handful of distinct values. The two commonest are 88105:Skyrim.esm
      (CraftingSmithingForge) and adb78:Skyrim.esm
      (CraftingSmithingArmorTable). Those two hex numbers are the same two
      constants CraftService.cpp hardcodes for tempering, which is an
      independent confirmation from the engine's own source.
      CNAM never lands on a KYWD. It lands on ARMO 457, MISC 523, WEAP 344,
      ALCH 37 and AMMO 19, and nothing failed to resolve. Read as the output it
      gives the right answer every time: RecipeWeaponElvenBow -> ElvenBow,
      RecipeArmorSteelCuirassB -> ArmorSteelCuirassB, RecipeLeatherFoxHide ->
      Leather01, RecipeIngotDwarvenScrapLarge -> IngotDwarven.
    So BNAM is the workbench keyword and CNAM is the output item.

    NAM1 is two bytes and it is 1 on 1344 of the 1387 records in the masters.
    Where it is not 1 it is right: RecipeLeatherStrips reads 4 and one hide
    does give four strips, RecipeIngotDwarvenScrapLarge02 reads 5, and the
    dwarven scrap pile recipes read 2 and 3. So NAM1 is how many the recipe
    makes.

    CTDA is 32 bytes and is the condition list, and it is read in full here.
    It was stepped over until 20 September, which is how three halves came to
    be reported as having work when they have none. The layout is
    libespm/include/libespm/CTDA.h, read out of the fork rather than
    remembered, and every offset below was checked against a record:
      byte 0     the operator in the top three bits, the flags in the low
                 five. 0x04 in the flags means the comparison value is a GLOB
                 form id rather than a number. Operator 0 is ==, 1 is !=, 2 is
                 >, 3 is >=, 4 is <, 5 is <=.
      bytes 4-7  the comparison value, a float.
      bytes 8-9  the function index, a uint16. Bytes 10 and 11 are padding and
                 hold leftovers from the Creation Kit, not data.
      bytes 12-15 and 16-19  the two parameters.
      the rest   what the condition runs on, a reference, and a trailing -1.
    Proved on TemperWeaponSkyforgeSteelSword, whose two conditions read as
    function 659 with no form parameter, and function 448 against
    5218e:Skyrim.esm, which resolves to a PERK record.

  The fork's own parser agrees, which is worth saying because it was read after
  the census rather than before it: libespm/src/COBJ.cpp maps CNTO to
  inputObjects, CNAM to outputObjectFormId, BNAM to benchKeywordId, NAM1 to
  outputCount and CTDA to conditions. Two independent readings, same answer.

  Eleven COBJ records in this build carry no CNAM at all, so they name no
  output. Nine of them are armour table temper records and they are listed as
  unowned with that reason rather than quietly dropped.

  THE POISON FLAG, PROVED THE SAME WAY

  An ALCH record's ENIT is 12 bytes or more: the value in gold as a uint32,
  then a flag word as a uint32. Read that way the flag word over the five
  masters takes exactly five values, which is what a bit field should look
  like, and each one lands on the right kind of record:

      0x00000000  205  potions:  RestoreAll, FortifyMagicka04, FortifyStaminaRate01
      0x00000001    7  potions with the no-auto-calc bit: BladesPotion, DLC1BloodPotion
      0x00000002    8  food:     FoodGourd, DLC2FoodBoarMeat, FirebrandWine
      0x00000003  107  food with the no-auto-calc bit: FoodVegetableSoup, FoodCheeseWedge01
      0x00020000   80  poison:   DamageHealthLinger03, WeaknessFire01, DamageStaminaLinger01

  So bit 0x00000002 is the food bit and bit 0x00020000 is the poison bit. Every
  record carrying 0x00020000 is a damage or weakness brew and nothing else
  carries it, and every record carrying 0x00000002 is something eaten. That
  flag is exactly the Blightbrewer and Physicker split classes.md asks for.

  WHAT IS NOT IN THE RECORDS AT ALL, AND THIS IS THE FINDING OF THE BUILD

  There are no alchemy recipes. Not few, none. Across the whole load order,
  5116 COBJ records, not one of them names an alchemy bench keyword. Skyrim's
  alchemy is not a recipe system: potions are worked out from the effects the
  ingredients share, in the alchemy menu, and no COBJ record is involved.
  Thornswood-Content.esp already defines a keyword called ThornswoodCraftingAlchemy
  and nothing in the build points a recipe at it.

  Since #1383 (4 October) two of its recipes do: the Physicker's poultice and
  remedy, made at that plugin's own lab, a create-object bench, and named in
  RECIPE_OWNER. They are the Physicker's only rows. The Blightbrewer still has
  none.

  There are no enchanting recipes either, with one exception. The only
  enchanting keyword any COBJ uses is 17738:Dragonborn.esm, DLC2StaffEnchanter,
  and its 160 recipes all output a staff. Enchanting a sword or a cuirass is
  the enchanting menu, not a record.

  So COBJ cannot carry the Alchemist at all, and it carries only the staff half
  of the Enchanter. Those halves are named in HALVES_WITH_NO_RECIPES below,
  with the reason, and each of them goes into the json's "halves" map with its
  own count and a craftsAtAll flag. Every other half must come out with recipes
  or this build fails.

  NOTHING IN HERE IS A REASON TO TAKE A HALF OUT OF CHARACTER CREATION, and
  this file said the opposite until 20 September. It wrote five half names into
  a field called cannotCraftYet and printed, at the end of every run, that the
  panel on K should refuse to offer them. Two of the five are Warrior/Bulwark
  and Warrior/Berserker. Warrior has no third half, so a panel built as
  instructed would have dropped the Warrior out of character creation
  altogether, and the Alchemist with it, leaving five professions of the eight.
  A half that makes nothing is a half with no crafting gate, not a half nobody
  may be.

  WHAT A CONDITION DOES TO A COUNT, AND IT IS THE FINDING OF 20 SEPTEMBER

  A COBJ can carry conditions, and until this script read them it counted a
  recipe as work whether or not anybody could reach it. The difference is not
  small. Measured on this build, of the 1728 owned rows the server is ever
  asked about, 1559 carry at least one condition, and 1125 of those want a
  vanilla perk that classes.md says nobody here will ever hold.

  Three numbers now come out per half instead of one: what it owns, what the
  server is asked about, and what somebody who picked that half this morning
  can actually make. Read down that last column and the table says something it
  never said before:
      Cook/Confectioner     28 recipes, 0 of them
      Enchanter/Bladebinder 161 recipes, 0 of them
      Cook/Hearthcook       112 recipes, 2 of them
      Woodworker/Charburner   4 recipes, 1 of them
      Smith/Platewright     771 recipes the server sees, 48 of them
  The first two fail this build unless they are named in
  HALVES_NOBODY_CAN_START with the measured reason, which they are, because the
  answer to both is a decision somebody has to make rather than a line of code.

  The Charburner's other three want a book: ThornswoodWoodcutterAdvanced, Expert and
  Master, out of Thornswood-Content.esp, which is this repo's own plugin. The
  search under 'what hands out the items these recipes ask for' went through
  all 101 plugins for a placed reference, a container or inventory line and a
  levelled list line, found 76 of the 79 items recipes in this table ask for,
  and did not find those three anywhere. So the Charburner is one recipe, Poor
  Charcoal, and the rest of classes.md's "firewood through to coke" is waiting
  on somebody putting those books in the world.

  WHAT RANK A RECIPE ASKS FOR

  classes.md has four ranks and says each one opens more of what you can make.
  No row in this table carried one until 20 September, so a gate built on it
  could only be all or nothing per half. Every row carries a rank now, and a
  rank on the row is also the only way to express the sister half rule the
  published page promises, that an Edgewright can beat out plain iron plate and
  no more.

  WHAT SETS THAT RANK IS THE NEXT SECTION AND NOT THIS ONE. From 20 to
  21 September it was the price of what the recipe makes, cut into shares by
  the RANK_SHARE knob. That rule left three halves with an empty rung and is
  now the FALLBACK: it ranks only the rows whose inputs no class in this world
  produces. Saying otherwise here is what a reader would carry away, so this
  paragraph says it once and hands over.

  INPUT COST, AND WHY THE PRICE OF THE OUTPUT CANNOT RANK ANYTHING

  The rule above shipped on 20 September and scripts\dev\Check-Balance.ps1 found
  three halves with an empty rung the next morning. It is not a threshold and
  no threshold fixes it. Measured on 21 September, on the table this script
  itself wrote:

      Cook/Confectioner      28 recipes, TWO distinct output prices in the
                             whole half: 18 at 6 gold and 10 at 14 gold.
      Enchanter/Bladebinder 161 recipes, TWO distinct prices: 160 at 5 gold,
                             because a staff's worth is in its enchantment and
                             not in its record, and one at 1250.
      Woodworker/Charburner   4 recipes, ONE price: all four at 2 gold.

  Four rungs cannot be cut out of two numbers. The data has no spread in it,
  and the measure was wrong rather than the cut.

  What the output SELLS for is a fact about a shopkeeper. What a recipe COSTS
  is a fact about work: somebody had to go and get the makings, and they had to
  be far enough up their own ladder to be allowed to. A dessert of flour and a
  cabbage is novice work whoever priced it; a staff that wants ebony is not.

  So a recipe's rank is the rank of the DEAREST thing it asks for, read off the
  producing tables in this same folder. That answers Patrick's question of
  21 September at the same time and by construction rather than by luck:
  "we also need to make sure the different tiers match across so like farmer
  matches with tiers of cook for their recipes, miner and smith, woodworker and
  miner and so on, so there isn't an imbalance". A Cook's rungs are the
  Farmer's rungs because they are the same numbers off the same table.

  THE REVERSE INDEX. ores.json, harvests.json with its four maps and hunts.json
  are all keyed by the base that gets worked and carry the item it hands over.
  The verbs this server answers itself are in no table at all: the salt quarry,
  the chopping blocks, the churn and the farmyard are answered in
  game\gamemode.js, so the items and the ranks are READ out of mineSalt() and
  the rest by ReadStationVerbs below rather than copied into a list here (the
  charcoal kiln was one until #2337 made it a bench), which is what
  stops the index and the server drifting apart in silence. This script needs
  the other direction, item -> rank, and it takes the LOWEST rank any class gets
  that item at: if a novice miner can find iron anywhere in Skyrim then iron
  costs novice, whatever some expert seam also drops.

  THE LOWEST RANK IS NOT ALWAYS THE FARMER'S, AND THE FARMER IS THE CLASS THIS
  MATTERS TO. All 11 crops of harvests.json are the same base records as rows
  in its harvests map, Cabbage is bcf48:Skyrim.esm in both, and for every one
  of the 11 the gatherer picks it at a rank at or below the one a farmer has to
  hold to grow it. So the crops map places nothing in the index and the farmer
  owns no entry in it, which was measured on 21 September after it had been
  asserted in a comment that said the opposite. That is the lowest-wins rule
  working rather than a fault: a Cook wanting a Red Apple can be handed one by
  a novice gatherer, so a Red Apple costs novice, whoever else grows it. What
  it is NOT is Patrick's tiers lining up by construction. The run now prints
  what each table placed and what it lost to an earlier one, and prints every
  owned row that is ranked below a class that produces one of its inputs, so
  the gap between the Cook and the Farmer is a number in the output instead of
  a claim in a comment.

  THE HOP, WHICH IS WHERE MINER TO SMITH AND HUNTER TO TAILOR COME FROM. Until
  21 September the index stopped at the ground. The owned recipes ask for 176
  distinct items and only 73 of them came out of it: the 103 that did not were
  led by Leather Strips, wanted by 924 recipes, Steel Ingot by 888 and Leather
  by 665, and not one of those is in the ground. Each is one recipe back from
  something that is: leather off a tanning rack from a hide a HUNTER skins, an
  ingot off a smelter from ore a MINER digs, and both benches are in the 1679
  rows nobody owns and anybody may make.

  So an input that is itself made by a recipe now costs what THAT recipe's
  dearest input costs, over all 5116 recipes and not the owned ones. It is a
  fixpoint and not a walk, for the reason written at FOLLOW_THE_HOP, and it
  settles in three rounds on this build. What it placed, measured the same two
  ways the index is measured: 116 of the 176 distinct items against 73 before,
  and 5711 of the 6708 input entries against 785 before. What is left is bought,
  looted or dropped rather than made: Dragon Bone on 138 rows, Linen Wrap on
  106, Dwarven Metal Ingot on 103, Firewood on 78, Butter on 46. Those rows
  still fall back to the price rule and still say so in rankFrom.

  A BREAKDOWN ROW IS NOT A SOURCE, and reading it as one undid the whole point.
  1072 of the 5116 rows turn a finished good back into stock, a fur hood into a
  Steel Ingot and a gemstone bow into a Ruby. Read like any other recipe they
  made Steel Ingot novice work for a HUNTER four hops away through a fur hood,
  and put 1301 of the Platewright's 2015 rows on novice. They are recognised by
  their shape, a MISC out of an ARMO, WEAP or AMMO, and HOP_THROUGH_A_FINISHED_GOOD
  is where that is argued and where it can be turned back on.

  A TEMPERING ROW IS NOT A SOURCE EITHER, and that one hid a year longer, because
  the only exclusion the hop had was the breakdown shape and tempering is the
  opposite shape. TemperArmorIronCuirass says Iron Armor out of one iron ingot,
  on the armour table, and the armour table improves a piece already in the pack:
  nobody has ever obtained an Iron Armor by tempering one. Read as a source it
  settled Iron Armor at novice for a MINER and ranked a 100 gold Robed Iron Armor
  novice against a price rank of advanced. 14 of the 43 supply routes in that
  build were tempering rows, placing 11 items and ranking 16 owned rows. They are
  recognised by their bench, the same two the engine throws out before it looks
  at a recipe, and HOP_THROUGH_A_TEMPER is where that is argued.

  THE OWNERSHIP RULE

  Written out in full in the knobs below, because that is where somebody will
  look to change it. In short: the output record decides, and the bench decides
  where the output cannot. An ALCH splits on the poison bit and on the dessert
  keyword; a WEAP splits on its animation type, which is what separates a bow
  from a sword; an ARMO splits on whether it is clothing, jewelry or armour; a
  MISC is usually stock rather than a finished good and goes unowned.

  Nothing is forced into a profession. A recipe nobody has decided about goes
  in the unowned map with the reason it landed there, and unowned means anybody
  may make it, which is the right default for something nobody has settled.

  Warriors do not craft. Bulwark and Berserker are halves of how somebody
  fights, not of what they make, and there are no warrior recipes to find. No
  recipe is invented for them, they are named in HALVES_WITH_NO_RECIPES with
  craftsAtAll false, and the profession is offered like any other.

  The Mage is in the roster too, with no halves at all, for the same reason: a
  panel built from the professions map in this file has to be able to offer all
  eight of classes.md's professions. What a mage knows is spells, and
  scripts\dev\Build-SpellTable.ps1 is what writes those.

  Read only. It touches nothing in the game folder and nothing on the VPS, and
  it proves that with a fingerprint of the folder before and after.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\dev\Build-RecipeTable.ps1
    .\scripts\dev\Build-RecipeTable.ps1 -Data 'C:\Thornswood\Game\Data'
    .\scripts\dev\Build-RecipeTable.ps1 -NoInstall
    .\scripts\dev\Build-RecipeTable.ps1 -JsOut "$env:TEMP\recipes.js"

  Exit code 1 if a recipe's output does not resolve to a real record, if an
  owner is not one of the professions in classes.md, if a half is not one of
  its two, if a recipe lands on a profession that has no halves, if a recipe is
  listed twice, if an owned recipe makes something the records put no price on
  and so cannot be ranked, if a half that is meant to have recipes has none, if
  a half named as empty turns out to have some, if a half with recipes has
  nothing at all a new character can make and is not named in
  HALVES_NOBODY_CAN_START, if a half named there turns out to have something,
  if one of the producing tables named in PRODUCER_TABLES is missing or has no
  map of that name, if a function named in STATION_VERBS is not in
  game\gamemode.js or hands over an item that is in no record, if that file's
  RANK_LADDER is not this script's RANKS, if the hop does not settle inside
  HOP_ROUND_LIMIT, if any half is left with an empty rung below a full one
  after both ranking rules have run, counting every owned row and counting only
  the rows the server is asked about, if a half holds a rung nobody at that rank
  could gather for and is not named in HALVES_WITH_AN_UNSTANDABLE_RUNG, or if
  the game folder changed while this ran. Nothing is written unless every check
  passed.

# HALVES THAT ARE MEANT TO COME OUT EMPTY, each with the measured reason.
#
# A half that can make nothing is a half nobody should be allowed to pick. That
# circle has bitten this repo twice, in farming and in gathering, so the check
# at the bottom fails the build when a half comes out with no recipes. This knob
# is the short list of halves where the emptiness is a fact about Skyrim rather
# than a mistake in this script, and every one of them was measured, not
# assumed. A half in this list that turns out to HAVE recipes also fails the
# build, because then this list is out of date and somebody has to look.
#
# These halves go into recipes.json under "halves", each with its own count and
# its own reason. WHAT THEY DO NOT DO IS COME OUT OF CHARACTER CREATION.
#
# Until 20 September this knob wrote its five names into a json field called
# cannotCraftYet and this script printed, at the end of every run, that the
# panel on K should refuse to offer them. Two of the five are Warrior/Bulwark
# and Warrior/Berserker, and Warrior has no third half, so a panel built as
# instructed would have dropped the whole Warrior profession out of character
# creation, and the Alchemist with it. gamemode.js offers warrior with exactly
# those two halves today.
#
# So each entry now says which of the two things is true, and the json says it
# too, because the reason strings alone left a consumer nothing to test:
#   Crafts = $false  the half is not about making anything. classes.md wrote it
#                    that way. Offer it, and the crafting gate stays quiet.
#   Crafts = $true   the half makes things and this build has no records for
#                    them yet. Offer it, and say so where somebody picking it
#                    can read it, because it is a gap rather than a design.
# Nothing here is a reason to hide a half. A half nobody may pick is a
# profession nobody may pick, and that is a bigger hole than an empty trade.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- ranks ----
#
# THE FOUR RANKS, from classes.md's own table and in its order. A row in this
# table carries one of these, and the gate compares it against the rank the
# character holds in that half.
#
# Until 20 September no row carried a rank at all, and a gate built on the
# table could only be all or nothing per half: either a Platewright made
# DaedricArmor on the morning they were created or they made nothing. Both of
# those contradict the published page. classes.md: "Each rank opens more of
# what you are able to make", and its Novice row is "the basics of your half,
# and not much of it".
#
# A rank on every row is also what makes classes.md's sister half rule
# expressible, and it is the only thing that can: "You get the novice work of
# your sister half for nothing. An Edgewright knows how to beat out plain iron
# plate." The gate reads that as: your own half at your own rank, plus the
# other half of your own profession at novice and no further. It cannot ask
# that question of a table whose rows have no rank.
$RANKS = @('novice', 'advanced', 'expert', 'master')

# WHAT RANK A RECIPE ASKS FOR. INVENTED. classes.md sets no numbers and nothing
# in the records ranks a recipe, so this is the judgement, in one place.
#
# The measure is the gold value of what the recipe makes, which is the one
# number the records already carry about how much of a thing a thing is, and it
# is the same measure Build-HarvestTable.ps1 ranks a plant by. What could not
# be copied from that script is its fixed gold ceilings, and the reason is
# printed under 'ranking' every run: the halves do not share a scale. What a
# Confectioner makes runs from a few gold to a few tens of gold, and what a
# Platewright makes runs to thousands. One ceiling in gold across all of them
# would put every dessert in the game at novice and every piece of armour above
# it, which ranks the Cook's whole trade as beginner's work and leaves a
# Platewright with nothing to start on.
#
# So the split is per half: sort that half's rows by what they make, cheapest
# first, and cut the list at these shares. Read as "novice is the cheapest
# quarter of your own half's work". Every half gets a novice rung by
# construction, which is the point.
#
# The spread each half actually has is printed every run, under 'ranking', so
# these shares can be moved against real numbers. Measured on 20 September:
#   Cook/Confectioner       28 rows from 6 to 14 gold
#   Smith/Platewright     2015 rows from 2 to 24634 gold
#   Woodworker/Woodwright  124 rows from 0 to 26305 gold
#   Woodworker/Charburner    4 rows, all of them 2 gold
# One gold ceiling across that is not a ladder, it is a wall with the Cook on
# the wrong side of it.
#
# TWO RUNGS COME OUT EMPTY IN THIS BUILD AND THAT IS THE TIE RULE WORKING, not
# a mistake. A cut never splits a run of rows that make things worth the same,
# because two recipes for things of equal worth on different rungs is a rule
# nobody could explain to the person it refuses. The Confectioner has 18 of its
# 28 desserts priced the same, so novice takes all 18 and advanced takes none.
# The Bladebinder has 160 staves priced at 5 gold each, because a staff's worth
# is in its enchantment rather than its record, so 160 rows sit at novice and
# the Aetherial Staff at 1250 sits alone at master.
#
# THIS RULE IS NOW THE FALLBACK AND NOT THE RULE, and the paragraph above is
# why. Read the two sentences again: three halves come out with an empty rung
# and no threshold anywhere can fix it, because the data those halves have is
# two numbers. Measured on 21 September, on the table this script wrote:
#   Cook/Confectioner       28 rows, TWO distinct prices: 18 at 6 gold, 10 at 14
#   Enchanter/Bladebinder  161 rows, TWO distinct prices: 160 at 5, one at 1250
#   Woodworker/Charburner    4 rows, ONE price: all four at 2 gold
# No ranking by output price makes four rungs out of two numbers. The tie rule
# is not the problem and moving the shares is not the answer; the measure is.
# What ranks a recipe now is INPUT COST, below, and the shares here rank only
# the rows whose inputs no class in this world produces.

    @{ Rank = 'master';   Upto = 1.00 }

# WHAT A RECIPE COSTS THE PERSON WHO HAS TO GATHER FOR IT. INVENTED, in the
# sense that classes.md sets no numbers for it, and measured in the sense that
# every number it reads comes out of a table built from the game's own records.
#
# PATRICK, 21 September: "we also need to make sure the different tiers match
# across so like farmer matches with tiers of cook for their recipes, miner and
# smith, woodworker and miner and so on, so there isn't an imbalance".
#
# That request and the three empty rungs above are the same defect from two
# ends. A recipe's rank came from what its output SELLS for, which is a fact
# about a shopkeeper and not about work. A dessert of flour and a cabbage is
# novice work whoever priced it. A staff that wants ebony is not. Rank a recipe
# by what its inputs cost somebody to get and the empty rungs close, and the
# Cook is reading the same numbers off the same tables the producing classes
# are ranked from.
#
# IT DOES NOT MAKE THE COOK'S RUNGS THE FARMER'S, and this comment claimed it
# did until 21 September. The index takes the LOWEST rank any class gets an
# item at, and every crop a farmer grows is also a plant a gatherer picks at
# the same rank or lower, so the farmer never sets a number here at all.
# Measured on the build of 21 September: 12 Cook rows are ranked below the
# farmer rank of a crop they ask for, Apple Dumpling at novice against an
# expert farmer's Red Apple among them. That is defensible, because the apple
# in the pot does not care who pulled it, but it is not the same sentence, and
# the difference is now printed under 'where a ladder sits below the class that
# grows what it asks for' every run instead of being asserted here.
#
# THE FIVE PRODUCING LADDERS, all already built and all in this folder. Each
# one is keyed by the base that gets worked, a vein or a plant or an animal,
# and carries the descriptor of the ITEM it hands over. This script needs the
# reverse of that: item -> the rank somebody has to hold to get it.
#
# THE ORDER OF THIS LIST IS THE TIE BREAK AND IT DECIDES REAL ATTRIBUTIONS.
# Lowest wins, and where two classes get the same item at the same rank nothing
# in the rule separates them, so the table read first takes it. The run names
# every tie it resolved that way, and names every item a later table's class
# has to climb higher for as well, because those two together are the whole of
# what the order of this list does to the output.
#
# NotAlsoIn: A BASE THE SERVER REFUSES THIS CLASS IS NOT THIS CLASS'S LADDER,
# whatever rank the table puts on it. Added 21 September, and it is the fix for
# the wrong half of the food split rather than a tidying.
#
# PATRICK, 21 September: "The farmer grows the crops? Those crops should be
# used to make food, why is a gatherer giving them all the food ingredient when
# they gather herbs and things".
#
# Two bases sit in the harvests map and in the crops map at once, on purpose:
# bb947 Tundra Cotton and bb953 Wheat. Their produce is an INGR and not a food,
# so the food rule in scripts\dev\Build-HarvestTable.ps1 that moved the other eleven
# crops out of the plant table never touches them, and CROP_BY_EDITOR_ID there
# names them as crops by hand. scripts\dev\Build-HarvestTable.ps1 leaving them in both
# maps is correct and this list reading both is what was wrong.
#
# The server does not let a gatherer near either of them. game\gamemode.js
# harvest() opens with `if (isCrop(baseDesc)) return null;`, and onActivate
# sends a crop base to farmActivate before it ever offers it to the plants. So
# a gatherer pressing a wheat plant gets nothing, at any rank, and the only way
# anybody in this world obtains Wheat or Tundra Cotton is a farmer at advanced.
#
# WHAT READING THEM AS THE GATHERER'S COST, measured off game\data\recipes.json as
# it stood before this line existed. Sack of Flour read suppliedBy gatherer on
# 36 Cook input entries plus 1 raw Wheat entry, and Thread read suppliedBy
# gatherer on 188 Tailor entries plus 1 raw Tundra Cotton entry: 226 of the 820
# supplied input entries the Cook and the Tailor ask for, credited to a class
# that cannot pick either plant. It is what made Check-Balance report
# 'farmer to Cook: DOES NOT HOLD. The farmer supplies 52 of 360 supplied input
# entries, 14%'. It also set the shipped rank on 105 rows of RECIPES_BY_ID that
# the craft gate reads, 63 of them Tailor and Haberdasher novice rows resting on
# Thread at novice, which rests on Tundra Cotton read as a novice gatherer's
# when the only way to hold one is a farmer at advanced.
#
# It is written as the name of another map in the same file rather than as a
# list of two descriptors, so that a crop added to harvests.json tomorrow is
# taken off the gatherer by the same line and nobody has to remember this one.

# THE SIXTH LADDER IS THE SERVER'S OWN STATIONS, AND IT IS READ OUT OF
# game\gamemode.js RATHER THAN COPIED OUT OF IT BY HAND.
#
# PATRICK, 21 September, on the whole chain: "the farmer would supply the cook,
# gatherer would supply tailor and alchemist, miner smith, hunter tailor and
# smith and so on." A station this repository put in the world is one of the
# places a class's goods come from, so it belongs in the index beside the five
# tables or the chain has a hole in it with nothing saying so.
#
# The five tables above are built from the game's own records. The stations are
# not in the game's records at all: STATIONS.saltQuarry is a base this
# repository's own plugin put in the world, gamemode.js answers it in
# mineSalt(), and no script writes a json table for it. So the reverse index
# could not see it. (STATIONS.charcoalKiln was the second until #2337: the kiln
# is a bench now and its charcoal is four recipe rows, ranked in RECIPE_RANK.)
#
# WHY IT IS READ AND NOT LISTED. Until 21 September this was a hand written list
# of four descs with the gamemode line quoted in a comment beside each one. That
# list is a copy, and a copy goes stale the first time somebody changes what a
# verb hands over or what rank it hands it over at, with nothing anywhere to
# say the table and the server now disagree. ReadStationVerbs below opens
# game\gamemode.js, parses its ITEMS and RANK_LADDER lines, takes the body of
# each function named here and reads the items out of the body itself. Change
# mineSalt and the index changes with it; rename an item and the build fails
# saying so rather than quietly dropping a producer.
#
# WHAT THE READER LOOKS FOR, and all three shapes were read off the two function
# bodies on 21 September rather than invented (burnCharcoal is gone since
# #2337; its two shapes stay readable for the next verb that has them):
#   an ITEMS.<key> under no rank guard          -> novice, the bottom of RANK_LADDER
#     mineSalt: addItem(actorId, ITEMS.saltPile, randInt(1, 2 + step))
#   an ITEMS.<key> inside a block guarded by step >= N or rankStep(...) >= N
#     -> RANK_LADDER[N]
#     mineSalt: the rare roll, [ITEMS.fireSalts, ITEMS.frostSalts, ITEMS.voidSalts]
#     behind if (step >= 2 && ...), and RANK_LADDER[2] is expert
#   a list of ITEMS keys indexed by rankStep -> element i is RANK_LADDER[i]
#     burnCharcoal: ['charcoalT1','charcoalT2','charcoalT3','charcoalT4'][rankStep(actorId, 'charburner')]
#   an ITEMS.<key> that is only ever taken is CONSUMED and is not produced
#     burnCharcoal: takeItem(actorId, ITEMS.firewood, cost), which is what the
#     kiln eats rather than what it hands over
#
# WHAT THE SALT QUARRY COST WHEN IT WAS MISSING ENTIRELY, measured on the build
# of 21 September: 98 owned rows ask for a Salt Pile and 38 ask for a rare salt,
# 138 input entries in all, and every one came back producedBy null. Two Cooked
# Boar Meat rows sat at advanced on the price rule and are novice work by the
# input rule.
#
# THE KILN LEFT THIS LIST ON 12 OCTOBER (#2337). burnCharcoal answered a press
# on the kiln and was read here as the Charburner's producer of the four
# grades. The press stood in for four charcoal recipes the plugin did not have
# yet; it has them now, so the kiln is a bench, the press goes to the engine
# and opens its menu, and the grades are made there by the rows RECIPE_RANK
# ranks. No recipe in the table asks for charcoal of any grade, which the hop
# below measures every run, so the index loses no producer anybody's row reads.
#
# The placed hive is a farmer verb. hive() hands over one Honeycomb.
# Honey, the jar, is still not a row of harvests.json.

# it reads comes out of the same tables and the same COBJ records as the rest.
#
# THE DEFECT IT CLOSES, MEASURED ON THE BUILD OF 21 SEPTEMBER before it existed.
# The owned recipes ask for 176 distinct items and the reverse index placed 73.
# The 103 it could not place were led by Leather Strips, wanted by 924 recipes,
# Steel Ingot by 888, Leather by 665, Ebony Ingot by 455 and Iron Ingot by 423.
# Not one of those comes out of the ground, and that is why the index could not
# see them: leather comes off a tanning rack and an ingot off a smelter, and both
# are COBJ records in this same table. A tanning rack recipe wants a hide, which a
# HUNTER skins. A smelter recipe wants ore, which a MINER digs. So the cost was
# always there, one recipe further back, and the whole of miner-to-smith and
# hunter-to-tailor was invisible because nothing followed that step.
#
# WHAT AN INPUT COSTS WHEN A RECIPE MAKES IT: what the dearest thing THAT recipe
# asks for costs, which is INPUT_RANK_IS_THE_DEAREST applied one level down, for
# the same reason. Where several recipes make the same item, the cheapest of
# them wins, which is PRODUCER_RANK_IS_LOWEST applied one level down: if there is
# any way to get a Steel Ingot for novice work then a Steel Ingot costs novice.
#
# IT WALKS ALL 5116 RECIPES AND NOT THE 3437 OWNED ONES. The smelter and the
# tanning rack are both in the 1679 nobody owns, so a hop over owned rows alone
# would place nothing at all. Unowned means anybody may make it, which makes
# those rows the most available step in the whole chain rather than the least.
#
# IT TERMINATES BECAUSE IT IS A FIXPOINT AND NOT A WALK. A depth limit was the
# other option and it is the wrong one here: it answers differently depending on
# where it starts, and there is no honest number to set it to. Instead every item
# starts at unknown, and each round recomputes every recipe's answer from what is
# known so far. An item's cost only ever moves from unknown to a rank, or from a
# rank to a cheaper one, and there are four ranks, so an item can change at most
# five times and the rounds cannot go on for ever. A smelter recipe that wants
# its own output, and there are such rows, simply never improves on itself: it
# reads its own cost, which is unknown or already at least as dear, and nothing
# happens. The run prints how many rounds it took and fails the build if it hits
# HOP_ROUND_LIMIT, which is the shape of a proof rather than a claim.
$FOLLOW_THE_HOP = $true

#         evidence that it is cheap. This is exactly the dragonbone defect
#         written out at UNPLACED_INPUT_RULE, one hop further down, where it
#         would be harder to see: an item priced off half a shopping list does
#         not say so on the recipes that then ask for it.
# $false  the dearest KNOWN input decides and the unknowns are ignored. The run

# its makings costs, and the hop is that same rule with one more way of getting
# them in it. Left alone, the two rules together say that if you can make a
# thing more cheaply than you can dig it up, it costs what making it costs.
#
# WHAT THAT ACTUALLY DOES ON THIS BUILD, measured on 21 September, and it is
# five items and no more:
#   Emerald, Sapphire and Ruby are master work at a deposit in ores.json, and
#   Immersive Weapons ships IWBreakdownGemstoneEmeraldBow and its two sisters,
#   smelter recipes that break a gemstone bow back down into the stone. The bow

#   and other breakdown rows the same way.
#   Cooked Skeever is advanced off a hunter and novice at a cookpot, which is
#   just cooking: a Salt Pile and some Skeever Meat.

# $true   IN USE. One rule for both ways of getting a thing. Every item where the

$HOP_MAY_UNDERCUT_A_CLASS = $true

# WHETHER A BREAKDOWN ROW MAY SET WHAT A THING COSTS. INVENTED: classes.md says
# nothing about it, and the question only exists because the hop follows recipes
# and Skyrim's mods are full of rows that run the chain backwards.
#
# A breakdown row takes a finished good and gives stock back: a smelter row that
# turns a fur hood into a Steel Ingot, a gemstone bow into a Ruby, a cutlass into
# Gold Ore. Hothtrooper44_ArmorCompilation and Immersive Weapons ship hundreds of
# them between them.
#
# WHY IT MATTERS, MEASURED ON THE BUILD OF 21 SEPTEMBER. With these rows reading
# like any other recipe, a Steel Ingot came back novice, supplied by a HUNTER,
# four hops away through IABArmorHeavyFurHoodBlack: pelts a novice hunter skins,
# made into a fur hood, smelted down into steel. It is not a mistake in the
# arithmetic. It is what the records say, and it is even true in the game. What
# it is not is a source: the hood had to be made first, so the steel cost
# whatever the hood cost plus the work, and a chain that reads it as a source
# hands the Smith's whole ladder to the Hunter at novice. On that run 1301 of the
# Platewright's 2015 rows landed on novice.
#
# The rows are recognised by their SHAPE and never by their name: the output is
# a MISC, which is stock, and one of the inputs is an ARMO, a WEAP or an AMMO,
# which is a finished good. STOCK_TYPE and FINISHED_GOOD_TYPES below are those
# two ends, and both are record types out of the game's own records rather than
# a judgement about any particular mod.
#
# $false  IN USE. A refund is not a source. An ingot costs what the ore costs,
#         which is the miner's ladder, and that is the chain Patrick described.
# $true   read them like any other recipe. The run prints how many items move
#         either way every time, so this is a number and not a preference.
$HOP_THROUGH_A_FINISHED_GOOD = $false

# The two ends of that shape, as record types. Read off the output type census
# this script already prints: MISC is the stock every smelter and tanning rack

$FINISHED_GOOD_TYPES = @('ARMO', 'WEAP', 'AMMO')

# WHETHER A TEMPERING ROW MAY SET WHAT A THING COSTS. INVENTED in the same sense
# as the knob above: classes.md says nothing about it, and the question only
# exists because the hop walks every COBJ in the load order.
#
# A TEMPERING ROW CREATES NOTHING. TemperArmorIronCuirass carries CNAM = Iron
# Armor and one CNTO, 1 Iron Ingot, on the armour table. Read as a recipe that
# is 'Iron Armor out of an iron ingot', which is exactly what the record looks
# like and is not what it does: the armour table improves a piece you are
# already holding, and Skyrim will not offer the row to somebody with no iron
# armour in their pack. Nobody has ever obtained an Iron Armor by tempering one.
#
# WHAT READING THEM AS SOURCES COST, measured off game\data\recipes.json before this
# knob existed. Iron Armor settled at cost 0 and was recorded as 'miner, novice,
# hops 2, via TemperArmorIronCuirass'. 002RecipeCommonArmor10 in
# CommonClothes.esp asks for 1 Iron Armor, 1 Leather and 2 Leather Strips, is
# worth 100 gold, and came out rank novice against rankByValue advanced, with
# whyThatRank reading 'the dearest thing it asks for is Iron Armor, which a
# miner gets at novice'. 14 of the 43 distinct supply routes in that build were
# tempering rows, placing 11 distinct input items, and 16 owned rows were ranked
# off one of them, every one of them reporting inputsWithNoProducer 0 when the
# true figure was higher.
#
# THE ROWS ARE RECOGNISED BY THEIR BENCH AND NEVER BY THEIR NAME, the same way
# the engine recognises them: CraftService::RecipeItemsMatch in the fork throws
# out the armour table and the sharpening wheel before it looks at a recipe at
# all, which is $BENCHES_THE_SERVER_NEVER_SEES above, read out of the fork. A
# name list would catch TemperArmorIronCuirass and miss whatever the next
# armour mod calls its own.
#
# The script already models these two benches as not-a-craft in three other
# places: $BENCHES_THE_SERVER_NEVER_SEES, the $fires = $false that marks an
# owned row as one the server is never asked about, and the block comment on
# the gamemode table saying a tempering recipe never reaches onCraft. The hop
# was the one place that did not apply it.
#
# $false  IN USE. Tempering is not a source. An Iron Armor costs what making an

#         UNPLACED_INPUT_RULE already knows how to answer.
# $true   read them like any other recipe. The run prints how many items move

# THE SECOND RULE, for a half the first two rules leave with an empty rung.
# INVENTED. classes.md does not set it, and it is here rather than in the code
# so that it is one edit to change and impossible to apply by accident.
#
# Some halves cannot be ranked by either honest measure, and that is a fact
# about the records rather than a failure of a threshold. The Bladebinder is the
# case this was written for, and it is worth writing out in full because it is
# the one place in this table where a rank does NOT mean what every other rank
# means. Measured on 21 September, on this build:
#   every one of its 161 rows sells for 5 gold but one, so price says nothing;
#   160 of the 161 want a Heart Stone, which ores.json ranks as master work for
#   a miner, so input cost puts the WHOLE half on master and leaves novice,
#   advanced and expert with nothing on them.
# Two honest rules, one rung between them, and a half nobody could ever climb.
#
# What DOES vary there is the shopping list: 5 distinct total input counts
# across the 161 rows against 2 distinct prices and 1 distinct input rank. The
# run prints those three numbers for any half it is about to re-rank, so the
# choice below can be argued with against numbers rather than taste.
#
# WHAT THIS COSTS, SAID OUT LOUD. A Bladebinder row ranked novice by this rule
# still wants a Heart Stone. The rank stops meaning "what it costs you" for
# that half and starts meaning "how long its shopping list is".
# scripts\dev\Check-Balance.ps1 counts every row more than one rung from its input
# cost and prints them by name: on this build it is 97 rows, all of them
# Bladebinder. It is the least bad of three answers, the other two being a half
# with one usable rung or an invented recipe, and it is a knob so that somebody
# who decides otherwise changes one line.
#
# AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN, WHICH WAS FOUND ON 21 SEPTEMBER. Counting
# rows on a rung cannot see whether anybody can stand on it. All 41 rows this
# rule put on the Bladebinder's novice rung want a Heart Stone, which
# ores.json ranks master on all four of its deposits, so a novice Bladebinder
# opens 41 recipes and can gather the makings for none of them. That is the
# exact circle the empty rung rule exists to catch, and both this script and
# Check-Balance were passing it, because the only thing the second rule changed
# was the label. So the standability check below now asks the other question,
# and a half that fails it has to be named in the knob under it with the
# measured reason or this build does not write a table.
#
# SETTLED ON 28 SEPTEMBER, issue #398, AND AGAIN ON 4 OCTOBER, issue #1622. On
# 28 September Patrick made Heart Stone deposits advanced mining, and the one
# rung hole fill below spread the staves over all four rungs. The miner page
# then put heart stone back on master, in one place (#1380, #1586, RANK_BY_ORE
# in Build-OreTable.ps1), so input cost puts every staff on master again, one
# rung cannot close three holes, and this rule would rank the half by shopping
# list once more. Patrick, 4 October, answering #1622: "B, each college book
# staff at its spell's rank". The thirteen are named in RECIPE_RANK, which fills
# novice, advanced and expert before the hole check runs, and the other 148,
# all cut, stay on master where their stone puts them. Measured on 4 October:
# novice 3, advanced 6, expert 4, master 148. So no half on this build reaches
# the second rule. It stays as the last resort for a future half, and the build
# prints by name any half that uses it.
#
# 'total inputs'    how many things the recipe wants in all, counting three
#                   firewood as three. This is the one in use: it is the
#                   closest thing the records have to how much work went into
#                   standing at the bench with everything ready.
# 'distinct inputs' how many different things it wants. Fewer distinct values
#                   in every half measured, so it collapses sooner.

# BEFORE THE SECOND RULE, TRY MOVING A FEW ROWS ONE RUNG. INVENTED, and it is
# here because the second rule turned out to be a much bigger hammer than the
# holes it was being used on. Issue #398.
#
# The second rule was written for the Bladebinder, a half where price and input
# cost both say one number for every row. It is applied to ANY half the first
# two rules leave with a hole, and it throws the whole half's ranking away to
# fill one rung. Measured on the build of 28 September, after Tundra Cotton moved
# to the gatherer (#626): the Liverywright's input cost put its 102 rows at
# novice 82, advanced 10, expert 0, master 10, a hole at expert and nothing
# else wrong. The second rule re-ranked all 102 by shopping list length and put
# 30 robes whose makings are novice work, four Thread and a Leather Strip, on
# expert and master: 39 Liverywright rows sat two rungs or more above what they
# cost, and the Confectioner lost five more the same way.
#
# $true   IN USE. A hole is filled first from the rung next to it, above and

#         two rules put it. How many move is the hole's share in RANK_SHARE
#         against its neighbour's, so the ladder keeps the shape the shares ask
#         for. Rows whose own input cost does not stand in the way move first,
#         then the cheapest (moving down) or the dearest (moving up). The rung
#         moved from always keeps a row, named ranks and the row moved to novice
#         for a new character never move, and a row moved once is never moved
#         again. Only a half this cannot close, the Bladebinder with all 161
#         rows on master, goes on to the second rule, and every move is printed.
# $false  every hole goes straight to the second rule, as it did before.

# means a shop or another recipe hands it over and no class rank is in the way.

This appeared the day the hop was followed and it was always true; before it, flour had no producer at all and every row read as costing nothing.

Patrick, 4 October (#1622): each college book staff at its spell''s rank, named in RECIPE_RANK. So the thirteen the Bladebinder page keeps sit novice 3, advanced 6 and expert 4, and the other 148, all cut, stay on master.

# somebody who can make staves, and a staff is refused until its spell is
# recorded. So a HasSpell row counts as reachable here when some BOOK record
# with the teaches spell flag names that spell, and the tomes are written into
# the needs list (taughtBy) and into the STAFF_SPELLS block the gamemode reads.
# A spell no tome teaches (the NPC copies some Apocalypse staves name) leaves

# is the same one classes.md gives for a bow: the length of it is a shaft of
# wood and the smith's part is the head on the end. A spear is a pole with a
# point, which is a Woodwright's work with an Edgewright's tip, and the server
# has to give it to one of them.
#
# BY NAME, LIKE THE INSTRUMENTS, AND FOR THE SAME REASON: a spear is a WEAP
# with the animation type of a two handed weapon, which is exactly what a
# greatsword is, so nothing on the record separates them. Matched as a whole
# word against the output's editor id and its name, so Spear matches and
# Spearmint does not, and the count is printed every run.
# WHOSE RACE MADE THIS.
#
# Patrick, 23 September: "Riekling stuff should only be able to be made by a
# riekling", and then "We already agreed on the race gate for race based items
# so if there is anything by another race aswell it should be race locked".
#
# ONLY A RACE SOMEBODY CAN ACTUALLY BE. Patrick, 23 September, reading a first
# list that had Falmer, Dremora and Draugr in it: "they are not playable races
# so they can be by anuone only playable races should be race locked". He is
# right: locking a recipe to a race nobody can choose is deleting the recipe
# by a longer road.
#
# So the list comes out of game/data/races.json, which reads the playable bit off
# the RACE record itself, at an offset measured against ten races everybody
# knows are playable rather than looked up. Twelve races are playable on this
# build: the ten vanilla ones, and two from Playable Rieklings.esp, which is
# the whole reason riekling gear can be locked to rieklings at all.
#
# AND THE TEN VANILLA NAMES ARE STYLES, NOT PEOPLES, WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE
# TAKEN BACK OUT. Nordic weapons, Orcish armour, Imperial armour and Elven
# everything are MATERIALS any smith with the perk hammers out, and always
# have been. Leaving Nord in this list would lock Nord Mail and Nordic Carved
# to Nords, which is not what anybody asked for and would gut the smithing
# tree. What is left on this build is riekling, which is the case he named.

# BUT A PEOPLE'S OWN DRESS IS NOT A MATERIAL, AND THAT DOES LOCK.
#
# Patrick, 23 September: "somtimes things are called bosmer, orsimer, altmer,
# dunmer", then "That's the exact reason I said it because of Bosmer armour",
# then "Which we should have in our mods", then "Also I believe we have Nordic
# armour somewhere".
#
# All of it is in the order and all of it was measured rather than guessed.
# Immersive Armors (Hothtrooper44_ArmorCompilation.esp) ships 41 Bosmer, 7
# Dunmer, 2 Orsimer and 16 Nord Mail recipes, and 4 Nord spectacle helmets.
# Every one of them was unlocked before this, and nothing above could ever
# have caught them: a RACE record spells that people WoodElfRace and the
# armour spells them Bosmer.
#
# THE LINE, WHICH PATRICK DREW ON 23 SEPTEMBER WHEN ASKED WHAT NORD GEAR DOES.
# A set named for a people is that people's dress and locks. A MATERIAL is a
# tier of metal any smith with the perk hammers out, and the name on it is the
# recipe rather than the maker, so it stays open. He chose the cultural sets
# alone. In the same build that means Nord Mail locks and Nordic Carved does
# not, though both say Nord: Nordic Carved is the quicksilver tier between
# Elven and Glass, and taking a whole tier off everybody who is not a Nord is
# not what any of this was for. Ancient Nord and Nord Hero stay open for the
# same reason. Bosmer armour locks, Elven armour does not.
#
# THE PHRASE IS WHAT THE THING IS CALLED AND THE VALUE IS WHAT THE RACE RECORD
# CALLS THE PEOPLE. 'Bosmer Boots' is recorded as woodelf, because the
# gamemode has nothing to compare against but WoodElfRace. The words of a
# phrase have to sit next to each other, so 'Nord Mail' catches Nord Mail
# Hauberk and never Nord Hero or Nordic.
#
# 'Spectacle Helmet' is here without a Nord in front of it because both of
# them are called Nord Heavy and Nord Light Spectacle Helmet, so the words are
# not adjacent. Measured: every spectacle helmet in this order is a Nord one.
# The run prints what each set caught, so the day a mod adds somebody else's
# spectacles the count says so.
#
# WHERE THE REST OF THE LIST CAME FROM. Patrick, 23 September: "look for
# anymoire culture sets". So every recipe name in the order was swept for the
# name of a people, a homeland or a great house, and what came back is below
# with the count it answered for.
#
# TWO THAT CAME BACK AND ARE DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. Thalmor, 5, is a political
# faction and it takes Bosmer as readily as Altmer, so robes named for it
# belong to no one people. Forsworn, 22, is a tribe at war with the Reach
# rather than a people, and its gear is fur and antler anybody can tie on.
# Neither is a race, and this gate is for races.
#
# Einherjar, Barbarian, Warchief, Stormlord and Viking came back too and are
# not here either: they are Immersive Armors flavour names, and none of them
# is a people anybody in Tamriel is born into.

# Every cowl a Tailor can make in this build is already caught by its editor
# id: the monk cowls by Monk, the coloured ones by Robes, Necromancer Cowl by
# Necromancer. Counted on the table of 20 September, the only row 'Cowl' won on
# its own was MCERecipeClothesFarmClothes03Hat, whose output is
# ClothesFarmClothes03Hat and whose name is the bare word Cowl. It is a farm
# hat. The word earned nothing and cost one row, so it is not here.
#
# 'Guard' stays, and whole word matching is what makes it safe. Counted on the
# table this writes today, fourteen of the Liverywright's 96 rows have Guard as
# a word in what they make, and every one of them is a hold guard cloak out of
# Cloaks&Capes.esp, Pale Guard Cloak through Winterhold Guard Cloak. That is
# faction dress by any reading of classes.md.

# THE FAMILY A ROW BELONGS TO, WHICH IS HOW THE RECIPE BOOK GROUPS IT.
#
# Patrick, 21 September, asking for the book in the K panel: "don't be very
# specific because for like tailor there are hundreds of clothing items". So
# the book lists families rather than items, and the family has to be read off
# the records the way the halves are, not typed out.
#
# WHAT WAS TRIED FIRST AND THROWN AWAY: the last word of the output's name.
# Counted on the 3437 owned rows of this build it gives 411 families, and the
# fourth biggest of them is the word White, 34 rows, because the armour
# compilations name a record 'Padded Fur Hood - White'. Blue, Black, Red,
# Green and Vile are families under that rule as well. A list that long and
# that wrong is exactly the "very specific" he asked against.
#
# WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE RECORDS, counted the same way: 3305 of the 3437
# outputs carry exactly one keyword that names a KIND of thing, 68 carry two
# and 64 carry none. The game already keeps four groups of kind keyword for
# its own use and this reads those:
#
#   the weapon type keywords    WeapTypeSword, WeapTypeBow, WeapTypeStaff ...
#   the armour slot keywords    ArmorCuirass, ArmorHelmet, ArmorGauntlets,
#                               ArmorBoots, ArmorShield
#   the clothing slot keywords  ClothingBody, ClothingHead, ClothingFeet,
#                               ClothingHands, ClothingCirclet ...
#   the food type keywords      MAG_FoodTypeStew, MAG_FoodTypeDessert ...
#                               out of Gourmet.esp, the same mod the
#                               Confectioner split is already read from
#
# TWO KINDS IS NOT A TIE TO BREAK. IT IS A RECORD THAT DOES NOT SAY. The 68
# are led by 48 cloaks out of Cloaks&Capes.esp, which carry ArmorHelmet or
# ArmorCuirass beside ClothingNecklace, because that mod hangs a cloak off
# whichever slot is free. Neither keyword is what the thing is. An order
# written here would pick one of them and file 48 cloaks under helmets with a
# straight face, so instead a record that names two kinds names none and falls
# through to its own record type with the 64 that name none at all. That is
# 132 rows of the 3437 and the run prints the three counts every time.
#
# classes.md sets none of this. It names the professions and their halves and
# says nothing whatever about how the work inside a half is grouped, so the
# groups below are this script's and the words are this script's words for
# what each keyword says. A kind keyword that is not named here still makes a
# family of its own, named from the keyword's own words by FamilyNameOf, so a

# The charcoal grades: Poor Charcoal at novice, Charcoal at advanced, Charcoal
# Briquette at expert, Coke at master, a grade a Charburner rank. That ladder is
# the design (docs\systems\professions\woodworker\charburner.md). Until #2337
# gamemode.js burnCharcoal handed the same ladder out by
# rankStep(actorId, 'charburner') on a press; since then these four COBJ
# records at the kiln's menu are the only way charcoal is made, so the rank on

#
# Until 21 September a CTDA on three of them held that line, testing for the
# woodcutter manuals. The manuals are gone, so the rank on the row has to carry
# what the condition carried.
#
# It is not derivable and here is the measurement of why. All four ask for the
# same one item, firewood, in rising amounts, and all four outputs are priced
# the same at 2 gold. So the price rule cannot tell them apart and the input
# cost rule cannot either: the moment chopWood gave firewood a producer, all
# four ranked novice together, because the dearest thing any of them asks for is
# novice work for a woodworker. Before that the second rule spread them by total
# input count, which happened to land close and was still an accident.
#
# THIS IS THE LAST RESORT AND IT IS CHECKED. A named rank is applied after every
# automatic rule and BEFORE the empty-rung and standable checks, so it cannot be
# used to write a ladder with a hole in it.

# ------------------------------- what hands out the items a recipe asks for -
#
# A recipe gated on GetItemCount wants something in the pack before the game
# will list it. If nothing in the whole load order ever hands that something
# out, the recipe is not gated, it is dead, and the half that owns it is
# smaller than its count says. The Charburner is the case: three of its four
# recipes want a woodcutter's book.
#
# HOW THIS SEARCHES, AND WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. Every plugin is read again and
# searched for the three subrecords that put an item within reach of a person:
#   NAME of 4 bytes  a placed reference, which is an object standing in a cell
#   CNTO of 8 bytes  a line in a container's or a character's inventory
#   LVLO of 12 bytes a line in a levelled list
# The form id is written into each plugin's own numbering first, out of the
# master list that plugin declares, because the same record is a different
# number in every file that mentions it.
#
# It cannot see three things, and none of them is guessed at: a record stored
# compressed inside a plugin hides its subrecords from a byte search; a Papyrus
# script handing over an item is not in any of these subrecords, and this
# server does not run Papyrus anyway; and a mod that gives the item through the
# Creation Kit's quest aliases lands in none of the three either. So a hit here
# is proof the item is reachable, and no hit is a reason to go and look rather
# than a proof of nothing.
#
# It is loud rather than fatal. The recipe belongs to whoever's plugin ships it
# and the fix is in that plugin, not in this table, and refusing to write 5116
# rows over a mod's dead recipe would leave the server with no table at all.

# -------------------------------------------------- what an input costs ----
#
# The reverse index: item -> the rank somebody has to hold before any class in
# this world can hand that item over, and which class that is. Built out of the
# five producing tables named in PRODUCER_TABLES, every one of which is in this
# folder and was built from the game's own records by its own script, and out
# of SERVER_PRODUCERS, which is the salt quarry this repository's own plugin
# and gamemode.js put in the world and no table is written for.
#
# This is the only place the two halves of the economy meet. Until it existed,
# the producing ladders and the crafting ladder were built by different scripts
# from different records with different rules and nothing compared them, so a
# novice Hearthcook could be handed a first recipe wanting a crop only an
# expert Farmer may grow and neither table could see it.
#
# EVERY PRODUCER OF AN ITEM IS KEPT AND NOT JUST THE WINNER. The index answers
# with the lowest, which is what a recipe costs, but a table that placed
# nothing used to be indistinguishable in the output from a table that was not
# read at all: the crops map contributed 0 of 137 entries for a year of builds
# and the run said '0 item(s) it is the first to name' and nothing else. The
# full list is what the cross-class report below reads to say that a Cook is
# novice on an apple a farmer has to be expert to grow.

# --------------- where a ladder sits below the class that grows what it asks --
#
# PATRICK'S QUESTION, ANSWERED AS A NUMBER INSTEAD OF AS A CLAIM. 21 September:
# "farmer matches with tiers of cook for their recipes, miner and smith,
# woodworker and miner and so on, so there isn't an imbalance".
#
# The reverse index answers with the LOWEST rank any class gets an item at, and
# that is the right answer for what a recipe costs: an apple in the pot does not
# care who pulled it off the tree. What it hides is the class that has to climb
# furthest for the same item, and for crops that is every one of them, because
# all 11 crops are also plants a gatherer picks at the same rank or lower.
#
# So this walks the OTHER producers, the ones $producer dropped, and names every
# owned row whose rank sits below a class that produces something on its list.
# That is not automatically wrong and nothing here fails on it. It is the
# imbalance stated: reading 'Apple Pie, Cook/Confectioner advanced, wants Red
# Apple, which a farmer grows at expert' is what lets somebody decide whether
# the Farmer's ladder or the recipe's rank is the thing to move.

# never regenerated. It went on saying that rank came from the price of what a
# recipe makes for a full day after input cost had replaced that rule and had
# changed 344 of the 1728 installed rows. The only statement in the repository
# of what the field the gate reads MEANS was contradicting the data beside it,
# in the file that ships to the server. So the marker moved up above the
# generated comment, and the script now owns the sentence as well as the rows.
# Whatever prose is still hand written sits above the opening marker, where it
