.SYNOPSIS
  Where the test harnesses are, and the name each one goes by. Dot-sourced by
  Gate-Harnesses.ps1 and Nightly-Harnesses.ps1, so the gate and the nightly
  can never disagree about which files are harnesses.

.DESCRIPTION
  Plan line 42 (1 Nov 2026): folders grouped by product, tests beside their
  code. A harness is a test-*.js or test-*.ps1 in one of two kinds of folder:

    tests\              the shared folder, for the checks that are about the
                        whole repository (the gate, the words, the secrets)
                        and the harnesses not moved yet. Named by file name
                        alone, test-gate-list.ps1, as they always were, so
                        the gate map, gate-excluded.txt and every harness's
                        own name for itself still hold.
    <product>\tests\    one folder below the top, a product's own:
                        launcher\tests\, site\tests\. Named by its path from
                        the repository with forward slashes,
                        launcher/tests/test-498-msbuild.ps1, the way the
                        nightly has named voice's (voice/test-turn-key.js).

  Get-HarnessFile turns a name back into its file, either kind. A name with a
  slash in it is a path from the repository; one without is in tests\.
