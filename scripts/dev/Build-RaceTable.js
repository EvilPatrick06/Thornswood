// Build-RaceTable.js
//
// Builds game\data\races.json and installs it into gamemode.js: every RACE record
// in the load order, by descriptor, with the name the record calls itself.
//
// WHY THERE IS ANYTHING TO BUILD
//
// Patrick, 23 September: "Riekling stuff should only be able to be made by a
// riekling", and then "We already agreed on the race gate for race based items
// so if there is anything by another race aswell it should be race locked".
//
// The server CAN see somebody's race: it is raceId on the appearance the
// client uploads, which is a runtime form id. A recipe row says which race it
// belongs to as a WORD, because a word survives a load order moving and a
// runtime id does not. This table is the join between the two, and it is the
// only thing that can make one: nothing else in the gamemode has ever read a
// race for any purpose.
//
// ONE LINE PER RACE, UNDER THE PLUGIN THAT MADE IT, WORTH WHAT THE LAST
// PLUGIN SAYS. Found on 24 September by the ale fix (#322), which had the same
// fault in Build-FoodTable.js. This used to key every version of a record by
// the plugin it was read out of, so UndeadDragonRace was three lines,
// 1052a3:Skyrim.esm, 1052a3:Update.esm and 1052a3:Dragonborn.esm. An override
// keeps the form id of the plugin that first made the record, so the game
// reports that race as 1052a3 of Skyrim.esm, and the server read Skyrim.esm's
// version of it rather than the one the game uses. The other two lines
// resolved to ids nothing ever reports. So a record's high byte is read
// through the plugin's own MAST list, the way Build-FoodTable.js and
// Build-FireTable.js do it, and the version kept is the last one in the load
// order. races.json rows say which plugin's version they were read from.
//
// Measured on this build on 24 September: 258 versions are 215 races. 32 of
// them are overridden, every one by Update.esm, Dawnguard.esm or
// Dragonborn.esm, and none of those overrides changes the editor id or the
// playable bit, so no race the game reports answers differently. What went is
// 43 lines nobody could reach. It matters the day a plugin in the order
// changes a race.
//
// Read only. It opens the plugins of the build, writes game\data\races.json, and
// replaces one generated line in game\gamemode.js.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts\dev\Build-RaceTable.js
//   node scripts\dev\Build-RaceTable.js --print
//   node scripts\dev\Build-RaceTable.js --plugins "C:\path\to\plugins.txt"

  WHETHER A RACE IS PLAYABLE, AND THE OFFSET WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN LOOKED UP.

  Patrick, 23 September, reading a list of race words: "Falmer, Dremora,
  Draugr are not playable races so they can be by anuone only playable races
  should be race locked".

  So the question is on the record. RACE carries a DATA subrecord and the
  playable bit is in it, and rather than trust a wiki this was found by
  testing every four byte offset in DATA against ten races everybody knows
  are playable and five everybody knows are not. Two offsets separate them,
  32 and 84, and 32 is the one the documented layout calls flags. At 32,
  NordRace and BretonRace carry bit 0 and FalmerRace, DremoraRace and
  DraugrRace do not.

  WHAT IT ANSWERS ON THIS BUILD: 215 races, twelve playable. The ten vanilla
  ones, and 1RieklingBlueRace and 1RieklingPurpleRace out of Playable
  Rieklings.esp, which is why riekling gear can be locked to rieklings at all.

  A LOCALISED PLUGIN DOES NOT HOLD ITS NAMES.

  Skyrim.esm and the four other masters are localised: their FULL subrecord is
  a four byte number pointing into a strings file, not the name. Reading it as
  text put mojibake in races.json for every vanilla race, 'NordRace' coming
  out beside a name of one stray character. Nothing broke, because the editor
  id is what everything compares against and the name is only ever there so a
  person can answer 'why did this count as a riekling', but that is the one
  job the field has and it was not doing it.

  The bit is 0x80 in the TES4 header flags. When it is set the name is left
  empty rather than filled with the number, because an empty name reads as
  missing and a number reads as a name.
