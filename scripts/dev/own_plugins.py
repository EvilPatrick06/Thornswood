"""
own_plugins.py

Where a builder reads a plugin of the load order from (#2923).

Thornswood's own plugins (Thornswood-Content.esp, Thornswood-Last.esp,
Thornswood-WoodworkerTrail.esp, and any other file in game/content) are made
and shipped from this repository's game/content. A game folder holds whichever
release last reached it, so a table read from there describes a plugin nobody
ships. Every plugin whose name is a file in game/content is read from there,
and every other plugin from the game's Data folder. The same rule is
OwnPlugins.js and OwnPlugins.ps1; tests/test-2923-own-plugins.js holds the
three to it.

Which plugins are in the load order is read here too (#2976). The game loads
Skyrim's five masters, then every line of plugins.txt that starts with '*'. A
line without one is a plugin Vortex or the launcher knows about and has
switched off: the game does not load it, and its file may be gone. Eight
builders parsed plugins.txt on their own and four of those took the switched
off lines as loaded, so on 20 Oct Build-DoorTable.py stopped on
ElysiumEstateSSE.esp, a switched off line whose file the launcher had removed
on 1 Oct. Every builder takes its load order from load_order.
