Build-Recost.py

Writes game/data/recost.json: the smith recipes that ask far more or far less
than the other recipes for the same kind of piece, at the same rank, in the
same metal, and what each one asks for instead. scripts/mods/Build-LastPlugin.py
reads it and carries each one, as the winning record with only its input
counts changed, in Thornswood-Last.esp.

WHY (issue #613)

The forge report of 25 September: "Several items are too cheap or too
expensive". An item has no gold price here (docs/systems/professions.md: what
it sells for is the price a person posts), so a recipe is too cheap or too
dear only next to the recipes for the same thing. Patrick, 21 October 2026, on
the report page (q-613-recost-basis), A: measure a forge recipe against the
same kind of piece at the same rank and metal; a steel cuirass should cost
about what other steel cuirasses cost. Gold worth is read nowhere here.

Measured 21 October from game/data/recipes.json: 1,146 smith recipes at the
forge and the Skyforge, 1,112 of them a piece the game tempers and made from
materials, 882 of those with at least two peers. Sixteen Riekling leather
body armours asked 2 Leather Strips where leather body armour asks 5, and
Thieves Guild Gloves 7 where leather gauntlets ask 3. 39 rows are outside
half to twice what their peers ask.
The recipes are the mods' own; nothing in Thornswood set them.

THE RULE, every number of it a knob below

  A row is a smith's (owner Smith) at the forge or the Skyforge and is asked
  of the server (fires).

  Its kind is its family in recipes.json (Body armour, Helmets, Swords: read
  off the output's own keywords), its rank is the rank in recipes.json, and
  its metal is what the game tempers the piece with: the inputs of the
  recipe at the sharpening wheel or the armour table that makes the same
  item. A steel cuirass is tempered with a Steel Ingot. A piece nothing
  tempers has no metal and is left alone.

  Rows of the same kind, rank and metal are peers. Its cost is how many
  materials it asks for, every input counted but gold coins (Gold001): 21
  forge recipes of Immersive Weapons and the Hothtrooper compilation ask up
  to 50 coins as well as their materials, and coins are money, not a
  material. Patrick, 21 October, q-3115-forge-coins, B: a forge recipe that
  charges coins costs only its materials, so every forge recipe that asks
  coins, whoever's work it is (bows and an eyepatch are at the forge too),
  has them taken out: its row in the table takes them to 0, and
  Build-LastPlugin.py leaves that input out of the record. A
  recipe that takes a finished piece (an Old Captain Helmet into an Old
  Helmet, a Nord Hero blade into another) is a conversion, not a piece made
  from materials, and is left alone: 18 rows. A group of fewer than PEERS rows
  is too small to say what is usual, and is left alone.

  A row asking under half the group's median, or over twice it, is re-costed:
  every material count is multiplied by the one factor that brings its cost
  to the median, then rounded, and never under one. Only the counts change: the
  same inputs, in the same order, the same output and bench. A row whose
  counts come out the same after rounding is listed under unreachable, with
  why, and gets no override.

  A recipe of a plugin Thornswood-Last.esp never copies a record of
  (last-plugin-policy.json notCopiedFrom: Immersive Armors, the Hothtrooper
  compilation, Patrick 17 Oct, #2454, used as-is and nothing built from it
  handed on) is listed under notCopied with whyNot and gets no override,
  coins or not, because an override is a copy of its record; it still
  counts as a peer, because the game still asks it. Measured 22 October:
  17 of them, 10 of those charging coins. One the policy carries by
  'COBJ <id>' is re-costed like any other.

WHY IT IS STABLE

  Once Thornswood-Last.esp carries the new counts, a recipes.json built from
  that load order reads them, and those rows would read as usual. So a row
  already in recost.json keeps the ORIGINAL inputs it was first measured
  with, for its own cost and for its group's median, every run. A row that
  leaves the load order leaves the file. A row that newly falls outside the
  band joins it.

Usage:
    python scripts/dev/Build-Recost.py           writes game/data/recost.json
    python scripts/dev/Build-Recost.py --check   exit 1 when the file is not what the rule gives
