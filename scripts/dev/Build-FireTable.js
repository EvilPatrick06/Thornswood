// Build-FireTable.js
//
// Builds game\data\fires.json: every base record in the load order that is a LIT
// FIRE, so the client can ask "is one of those near me" and the server can
// warm somebody up.
//
// WHY THERE IS ANYTHING TO BUILD
//
// Patrick, 23 September, with five screenshots of the meter reading Fine 50
// outside at night, beside a brazier, inside the Bannered Mare and standing
// in the middle of its fire pit: "not any warmer when near or in fire or in a
// building also make so if you are in a fire you catch on fire". Then:
// "yeah forges and stuff like that should be included too because they are
// hot".
//
// The temperature meter has worked since it was written. Nothing ever told it
// where anybody was standing, so n.place was always '' and the target was
// always comfort. The server cannot know: whether there is a fire in front of
// you is a fact about the machine drawing the world. The client has
// Game.findClosestReferenceOfType, which needs a BASE FORM, and that is what
// this table is.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A FIRE, MEASURED RATHER THAN TYPED
//
// Nothing here is a list of form ids from memory. Every row is read out of
// the plugins of the build on this machine, and the rule is on the record:
//
//   1. THE FLAME ITSELF. The thing that burns in Skyrim is not the fireplace,
//      it is a separate object placed in it: a movable static whose model is
//      one of the fire effects (Effects\FXfireWithEmbers*, Effects\FXFire0*,
//      Effects\BFXFireVol*) or one of the wood fires
//      (Clutter\WoodFires\*Burning*, Clutter\Giant\GiantCampfire01Burning).
//      A fireplace alcove is architecture and is cold; the FXfire sitting in
//      it is the fire. That is why this matches on the MODEL PATH and not on
//      the name: hundreds of Skyrim statics have "fireplace" in their editor
//      id and are stonework.
//
//   2. THE WORKING HEAT. A forge, a skyforge and a smelter are hot, which is
//      Patrick's line above. Those are crafting furniture markers and have no
//      flame model of their own, so they are matched by editor id, which is
//      the only thing that identifies them. The list of needles is in
//      CRAFT_HEAT and each one is checked to exist.
//
//   3. NOT WHEN IT IS OUT. Campfire01LandOff, Campfire01Off,
//      FireplaceWood01Off and FXfireWithEmbersOut are the unlit versions of
//      rows 1 and 2, and they are the reason a name match alone would have
//      warmed people up at a dead fire. Anything whose editor id or model
//      ends in Off or Out is dropped, and the count of what was dropped is
//      printed so the rule can be seen working.
//
// Read only. It opens the plugins of the build and writes game\data\fires.json.
// It touches nothing in the game folder and nothing on the VPS.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts\dev\Build-FireTable.js
//   node scripts\dev\Build-FireTable.js --data "C:\Thornswood\Game\Data"
//   node scripts\dev\Build-FireTable.js --print
//
// Exit code 1 if a plugin will not parse, if any CRAFT_HEAT needle matches
// nothing, or if the table comes out empty. Nothing is written unless every
// check passed.

/*
  EVERY PLUGIN IN THE ORDER, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT, and this used to be
  Skyrim.esm alone.

  WHAT THE OLD LIMIT COST, measured 23 September. Patrick walked into a fire
  and the temperature did not move. The plugin log showed the place tick alive
  and its fire distance never leaving nothing, so no fire of ours was ever
  within three hundred units of somebody standing in one. This collection has
  EMBERS XD, which is a fire overhaul, and Embers XD.esp defines SIXTEEN lit
  fire bases of its own: FXfireWithEmbersLogs02, 03 and 04, FXFirepit01,
  FXfireWithEmbersLight02 and 04, its own Campfire01LandBurning variants and
  the rest. Those are the fires people actually stand next to in this build,
  and none of them was in a table read out of Skyrim.esm.

  THE REASON THE LIMIT EXISTED WAS REAL and it is answered rather than
  ignored: a form id is only the number the game uses when its plugin is at
  load index 00. A mod's ids move whenever anybody adds a mod. So the table no
  longer carries runtime ids for anything but Skyrim.esm. It carries the FILE
  and the LOCAL id, and the client resolves them with Game.getFormFromFile,
  which is the engine's own answer to this question and exists in the client
  build (Modules\skyrimPlatform.ts, Game.getFormFromFile).

  A record that OVERRIDES a master's is credited to the master that defines
  it, because that is the file the engine resolves it from and the override is
  what it hands back.
