Build-BuildingHolds.py

Gives every claimable building the hold its doors open onto, measured from the
plugins, and writes it down: game\\data\\building-holds.json and the
BUILDING_HOLD block in the property block of game\\gamemode.js.

WHY (#2551)

Patrick, 16 October, answer C: a Steward evicts and sets rent only in their own
hold, with a table giving every claimable building the hold its door opens
onto. Until this, DATA.cellToHold named a hold for 601 of the 850 buildings
and nothing else knew the rest, so any Steward could evict at any door.

WHERE A HOLD IS IN THE DATA, measured on 17 October over this load order:

  A hold is a location record (LCTN): WhiterunHoldLocation and the other eight,
  and DLC2SolstheimLocation for Raven Rock. A place is in a hold when its own
  location's parent chain (PNAM) reaches that record. That chain is the game's
  own answer to which hold a place is in, and the only one the data holds:

    - No region (REGN) bounds a hold. Skyrim's regions are weather, sound,
      map and navmesh regions (WeatherWhiterun, AudioExtReachCity), none of
      them a hold's edge.
    - An encounter zone (ECZN) names one place's location, a dungeon's or a
      town's, never a hold's ground.
    - Only 1,011 of Tamriel's 11,186 exterior cells carry a location (XLCN),
      the ones in and around a town, a farm or a dungeon. The rest of the
      wilderness is in no hold at all, in the data and so in the game.
    - A location's own list of its exterior cells (LCEC) disagrees with those
      cells' locations in 68 places, so it is not read.

  So a place's hold is read from its location: an exterior cell's own XLCN,
  or its worldspace's when the cell has none (WhiterunWorld is WhiterunLocation
  throughout), and a room's own XLCN.

THE RULE, for each building (an interior a door leads into, Build-DoorTable.py):

  1. The doors that lead into it each stand somewhere: that is the place the
     door opens onto. Every door the game does not place (deleted, or disabled
     from the start) is left out.
  2. The hold of each such place, as above. A room with no location of its
     own is walked through to the places its own doors open onto, the next
     ring out, so a cellar under an inn answers with the inn's hold. A place
     outside with no location is a dead end.
  3. The nearest ring with any hold decides. One hold: that is the building's.
  4. Two or more (a passage between two holds, a back door into Blackreach):
     the building's own location picks between them when it is one of them.
  5. None: the building's own location, when it reaches a hold.
  6. Anything else is refused, with the reason, and the building is left out
     of the table. Nothing is guessed: no nearest town, no lore.

THE CROSS-CHECK. DATA.cellToHold (game\\data\\data.json) is read for every
building it names. Each disagreement has to be written in DISAGREE below with
which answer is right and why, or the build stops.

WHAT IT READS. game\\data\\doors.json for the buildings and their doors (the
same table BUILDING_BY_DOOR and BUILDING_NAME are built from, and the build
stops if the gamemode's buildings are not doors.json's), and the load order of
game\\data\\last-plugin.json then Thornswood-Last.esp and
Thornswood-WoodworkerTrail.esp, last plugin wins, with the repository's own
plugins from game\\content, the way Build-WoodworkingBenches.py reads it. The
game folder has to hold the collection's own bytes
(records\\collection-plugins.json).

WHAT IT WRITES. game\\data\\building-holds.json: every building with its hold,
how it was found and the places it was found at; every building refused and
why; the cross-check; every plugin read with its size and sha256. And
game\\gamemode.js, between the BUILDING_HOLD markers: building to hold, in the
town keys the offices use. --check writes nothing and fails when either is not
what the plugins give now.
