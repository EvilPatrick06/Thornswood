  Check-Secrets.ps1

  Read only. Looks for anything that must never leave a machine: in the files
  this repository tracks, in a pack or installer zip, in the installer's staged
  folder, or in a built program. For every hit it prints the file, the line and
  the name of the rule, and NEVER the thing it matched. A scan that prints what
  it found has just published it, in a build log anybody on the repository can
  read.

      .\scripts\dev\Check-Secrets.ps1                            every file git tracks here, and in
                                             each submodule that is checked out
      .\scripts\dev\Check-Secrets.ps1 -Zip <pack, installer zip, or Setup program>
                                             the entries of a zip. A Setup program is a
                                             program with a zip appended; that zip is read too.
      .\scripts\dev\Check-Secrets.ps1 -Dir <installer stage>     a staged folder
      .\scripts\dev\Check-Secrets.ps1 -Binary <Thornswood.exe>   a built program, byte by byte

  Exit 0 when nothing was found, 1 when something was, 2 when something could
  not be read. A 2 is not a pass.

  WHY IT EXISTS. Entry 236. Two secrets have shipped inside built artefacts, and
  neither was in the source, so nothing that only read the source could have
  seen them:
    - the installer carried Data\Platform\PluginsNoLoad\auth-data-no-load.js,
      the SkyMP client's saved sign in from the machine that built it (the
      header of Ship-Rules.ps1 tells it);
    - nine main packs from 18 to 20 September, and at least two dev packs
      beside them, carried Data\Platform\voice-token.txt, the voice join token
      of the machine that built them, because Ship-Rules did not list it yet.
  Ship-Rules lists both now. This is the check that does not wait for somebody
  to think of the file first: both names say what they are, and the token has
  a shape. In a pack or the installer it also asks Ship-Rules itself, so a file
  that the rules keep out and that got in anyway stops the release.

  The tree scan reads what git tracks and nothing else, so the credential files
  that sit gitignored on the shipping machine (the two webhook files,
  server-secret.txt, config.json) are never opened.

  AND WHAT ITS SUBMODULES TRACK (#1326). engine\skymp, the fork every server
  and client build is made from, is a submodule: git ls-files here lists it as
  one gitlink, which is not a file, so not one of its files was ever read.
  Each submodule that is checked out is now read the same way, by its own
  git ls-files, its paths reported and allowed under engine/skymp/. One that
  is not checked out is said by name, and -Submodules Require counts it as
  not read, so a run that fetched it first cannot pass without having read
  it. The fork's own submodules (vcpkg) are Microsoft's and other people's
  code, not the fork's, and are named and left.

  A known non-secret that a rule matches goes in Check-Secrets.allow.txt beside
  this script, by path and rule, with a line saying why it is safe. Never a real
  secret: a real one is taken out and replaced, not allowed.

# The matching runs in this small compiled class and not in PowerShell, for a

# large string to a .NET method: one regex over the 6 MB recipes.json took
# 1.4 s that way and the whole tree took 41 s, where the -match operator over
# the same text took 0.03 s and Windows PowerShell 5.1 took 0.013 s for the
# same call. Here the bytes go in, and only a rule name and a position come
# back out. The value never reaches PowerShell at all, which is the other half
# of never printing it. C# 5, so the Framework csc that Windows PowerShell uses

# .NET ZipFile.OpenRead does not read a zip concatenated onto a program.
# The Setup is that shape: the program first, then the zip, and the zip own
# offsets count from the zip, not from the first byte of the file. Asked for
# the central directory, Windows PowerShell throws because the entry count
# does not match, and PowerShell 7 does not throw at all: Entries is empty,
# every rule is skipped, and the scan says the file is clean. Python zipfile
# finds the end-of-central-directory record at the end of the file and
# corrects for the bytes in front. This does the same correction and reads
# that zip. A real empty zip has no local-file header, so it still reports no
# entries. A file that claims to be empty and still holds one is not a pass.
