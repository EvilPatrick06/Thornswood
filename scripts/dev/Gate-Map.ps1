.SYNOPSIS
  Fetches the newest map of which gate harnesses a change can reach: the
  gate-map artifact of main's nightly trace on GitHub's runner (#5183,
  #4009).

.DESCRIPTION
      .\scripts\dev\Gate-Map.ps1 -Fetch <dir>      (the token in GATE_MAP_TOKEN)

  .github\workflows\gate-map.yml traces the whole gate every night on
  GitHub's hosted Windows runner and keeps latest.json, <key>.map.json and
  <key>.tree.gz as an artifact named gate-map. This reads the newest finished
  runs of that workflow, newest first, and from the first that is main's own
  (gate-map.yml on main, from the schedule, a push to main or a run by hand, of this
  repository) and still holds a gate-map artifact, writes those three files
  into <dir>, the shape scripts\dev\Run-Gate.ps1 and Check-Change.ps1 read.
  Exit 0 with a map in <dir>, 1 without, saying why.

  WHY ONLY MAIN'S RUN. A pull request's code runs in its own workflow and
  can upload anything; a pull request that changes the trace's own scripts
  runs gate-map.yml too, and keeps gate-map-trial, which this never reads.
  So a map counts only from a run GitHub says is gate-map.yml on main from
  the schedule, a push to main or workflow_dispatch, read back for each run, and only an
  artifact named gate-map whose latest.json names that run's own key.

  BEFORE #5183. Until #4983 an administrator task on the box traced each
  main build and main's build printed the map into its log (-Hand, gone with
  it), which this read back; since then no build ran on the box, no map was
  made, and every pull request ran the whole gate.

  The token needs actions: read (an artifact's download needs a token even
  on a public repository). -Fetch reads it from GATE_MAP_TOKEN and takes it
  out of the environment before anything else, so it is never typed or on a
  command line (#4079, tests\test-secrets-off-command-lines.ps1). Run-Gate.ps1
  takes it out of the step's environment before any harness starts and sets
  it only around this call. tests\test-4009-gate-map.ps1 holds this.

.PARAMETER Fetch
  The folder to write the newest map into. Whatever is there goes.

.PARAMETER Repository
  owner/name, GITHUB_REPOSITORY by default, else ThornswoodRP/Thornswood.

.PARAMETER Api
  GitHub's API, https://api.github.com by default (the harness stands in).
