  Check-Balance.ps1

  Reads the five generated tables and says whether the ladders line up.

  WHY

  Patrick, 21 September: "we also need to make sure the different tiers match
  across so like farmer matches with tiers of cook for their recipes, miner and
  smith, woodworker and miner and so on, so there isn't an imbalance".

  He is right and it is checkable rather than a matter of taste. Every class
  produces things at a rank and every profession consumes them at a rank, and
  the two ladders are built by different scripts using different rules against
  different records. Nothing has ever compared them. A novice Hearthcook whose
  first recipe needs a crop only an expert Farmer may grow is a dead end that
  neither table can see on its own, because each one is internally consistent.

  WHAT IT CAN SAY TODAY, AND WHAT IT CANNOT

  It compares the SHAPE of every ladder: how many things sit on each rung, and
  whether any rung is empty. An empty bottom rung is the failure that has now
  been shipped twice here, once in farming and once in gathering, and both times
  it meant a new character could do nothing at all and had no way to earn the
  rank that would have let them.

  COUNTING ROWS ON A RUNG IS NOT ENOUGH, WHICH WAS FOUND ON 21 SEPTEMBER. This
  script read the counts, found four rungs of the Enchanter/Bladebinder with 41,
  56, 40 and 24 recipes on them, and said every ladder was sound and exited 0.
  All 41 rows on that novice rung want a Heart Stone, and ores.json ranks all
  four Heart Stone deposits master, so a novice Bladebinder opens 41 recipes and
  can gather the makings for none of them. That is the same dead end as an empty
  rung wearing a label, and the label came from the second rule in
  Build-RecipeTable.ps1, which re-ranks a half by how long its shopping lists
  are when neither price nor input cost can tell its rows apart. So every rung
  is now checked for whether anybody standing on it could gather for even one
  row of it, and a half where that fails and is not written down in the table
  with a measured reason fails this script. (Patrick settled the Bladebinder on
  28 September, issue #398, by making Heart Stone deposits advanced mining. The
  miner page put heart stone back on master (#1380, #1586), and on 4 October,
  issue #1622, Patrick answered: each college book staff at its spell's rank.
  So the thirteen staves sit on novice, advanced and expert below a master
  stone, named in RECIPE_RANK and in the table's own rungsNobodyCanGatherFor.)

  It also follows a recipe to the class that produces its inputs, which it
  could not do until 21 September. game\data\recipes.json records WHICH items each
  recipe wants now and not just how many: Build-RecipeTable.ps1 read the CNTO
  subrecords to count them and dropped the form ids, and it keeps them. Every
  owned row carries inputItems, each with the class that produces that item and
  the rank it is produced at, and inputRank, the dearest of them. So the chain
  report below is a number rather than a shape: how far each half's recipes sit
  from what their inputs cost, and every case more than one rung out.

  AND IT FOLLOWS THE HOP, which it could not until 21 September. Leather Strips,
  Steel Ingot and Leather are the three commonest inputs in the whole table and
  none of them comes out of the ground: each is made at a smelter or a tanning
  rack, one of the 1679 rows nobody owns. Every input now carries suppliedBy as
  well as producedBy, the class the input rests on however many benches away,
  so this script can say which class supplies which half as a table of counts.
  The four pairings Patrick named are checked against it by name, one line each,
  and a pairing that does not hold is reported as not holding.

  Read only. It opens five json files in this repository and writes nothing
  anywhere, and it does not touch the game folder or the VPS at all.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\dev\Check-Balance.ps1
    .\scripts\dev\Check-Balance.ps1 -Quiet     the verdict lines only

  Exit code 1 if any ladder has an empty rung below its top, or a rung nobody
  standing on it could gather for that the table has not already written down
  with a reason. Those are the two shapes that are always wrong. And, since
  issue #398, if a recipe sits more than one rung from what its inputs cost
  and is not kept on purpose: see FarReason.

Head 'The chain: what a recipe asks for against what it is ranked at'

# THIS IS THE ANSWER TO PATRICK'S QUESTION, AS A NUMBER.
#
# Every owned row of recipes.json now carries inputItems, each with the class
# that produces it and the rank that class gets it at, and inputRank, which is
# the dearest of those. Comparing inputRank against the row's own rank says
# exactly how far a profession's ladder sits from the ladders that feed it.
#
# A row whose rank matches its inputRank is in step: you can gather the makings
# on the same rung you are allowed to use them. A row ranked BELOW what its
# inputs cost is the dead end that started all of this, a novice Hearthcook
# handed a recipe wanting a crop only an expert Farmer may grow. A row ranked
# ABOVE what its inputs cost is the other kind of waste: the makings are in
# your pack and the bench still refuses you.
#
# Only the rows the server is asked about are counted, for the same reason the
# ladder counts above skip tempering: a row the gate is never asked about
# cannot be in step or out of it with anything.
#
# WHY A ROW IS MORE THAN ONE RUNG OUT, issue #398, whose done-when is that every
# such row is one somebody looked at and kept. Every one falls under one of
# two causes, each read off the row itself, or it is a new imbalance nobody
# has looked at and this script fails on it:
#   kept         its rank is named outright in RECIPE_RANK, with the reason on
#                the row. The four charcoal grades: coke is a master
#                charburner's alone, and the kiln's menu is the only place
#                charcoal is made since #2337, so the row says it. The
#                kept smelt rows, novice smith work whatever the ore costs
#                (#1391, #1400). And the thirteen college book staves, each at
#                its spell's rank below a master miner's Heart Stone (#1622).
#   unproduced   ranked ABOVE what its inputs cost because something on its list
#                is produced by no class (Dragon Bone, Linen Wrap and the like),
#                so the price holds it up, and the row says it is kept on
#                purpose: Patrick decided on 28 September that those stay dear.
# There is no third. The Bladebinder's staves were one until 28 September,
# ranked by the second rule below what a master miner's Heart Stone cost.
# Patrick made the stone advanced mining that day, and when the miner page put
# it back on master he answered #1622 on 4 October: each college book staff at
# its spell's rank. That is a decision written in RECIPE_RANK, so those rows are
# kept, and a second rule row out of step is still a new imbalance.

# PATRICK, 21 September: "the farmer would supply the cook, gatherer would
# supply tailor and alchemist, miner smith, hunter tailor and smith and so on."
#
# That is a claim about the whole economy and it is now countable, which it was
# not before the hop. Every input of every owned recipe carries suppliedBy: the
# class the input rests on, however many benches away it is. A Steel Ingot is
# produced by nobody and supplied by a miner, one smelter away from his ore. A
# Leather Strip is supplied by a hunter, two benches from the hide.
#
# WHAT IS COUNTED, SAID PLAINLY. One count per input entry: a recipe wanting
# Leather Strips and Steel Ingot is one entry for the hunter and one for the
# miner, and asking for four strips is still one entry, because this is a
# question about who supplies whom and not about tonnage.
#
# EVERY OWNED ROW IS COUNTED AND NOT ONLY THE ONES THE SERVER IS ASKED ABOUT.
# The ladder counts above skip tempering, because a row the gate never sees
# cannot be in step with anything. This is a different question: somebody
# tempering a sword really does consume the ingot, and leaving 1720 tempering
# rows out would hide most of what the Smith buys from the Miner.

# The chain above reads inputRank, which is what an input costs at the CHEAPEST
# class that produces it, because that is what a recipe costs to gather for. It
# cannot see the class that has to climb furthest for the same item, and for the
# Farmer that is every item: all 11 crops in harvests.json are also plants a
# gatherer picks at the same rank or lower, so the farmer sets no inputRank
# anywhere in the table and was invisible in this report until 21 September.
#
# alsoProducedBy on an input names every class that has to be higher up its own
# ladder for the same thing. A Cook row ranked below one of those is the
# imbalance in Patrick's own words, farmer against cook, stated as a row and a
# rank rather than as a feeling.
#
# It does NOT set the exit code, for the reason the chain gaps do not: which of
# the two ladders should move is a decision, and a Confectioner baking with an
# apple a gatherer picked at novice is defensible whatever rank the farmer who
# grows one has to hold.
