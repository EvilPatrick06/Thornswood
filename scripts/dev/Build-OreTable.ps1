  Build-OreTable.ps1

  Builds game\data\ores.json: the table the server needs to answer an ore vein.
  Nothing in it is typed from memory. It is read out of the plugins of the
  build on this machine.

  WHY THERE IS ANYTHING TO BUILD

  The server does not handle a vein today. A vein is an ACTI record whose
  behaviour is a Papyrus script (MineOreScript), the server runs no scripts,
  so mining happens on the client and nothing gates it: anybody who walks up
  to a seam works it, miner or not, novice or master. classes.md says the
  opposite. 'Mine' is the miner's verb and rank decides which source somebody
  may work at all and how much it gives.

  The gamemode can take a base over the same way the salt quarry is taken
  over: publish the base in server-bases.json (publishServerBases) and answer
  it in mp.onActivate (mineSalt). For that it needs the veins, and what each
  one gives. That is this table.

  WHERE THE ORE COMES FROM, MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED

  A vein names its own ore. The script attached to the record lives in the
  record's VMAD subrecord, and a script's properties are in there with it:
  script name, then a property name, a type byte, and the value. The ore is
  the object property called Ore, and an object property is a form id. So the
  ore is read out of the record, not out of the record's title.

  Nothing here falls back to matching a vein's name against an ore's name.
  VMAD reads, and every row says where it came from: readFrom in
  game\data\ores.json names the property that row was read out of. What this build
  holds, measured on 20 September: 586 records carry the script, 581 of them
  name an ore, and the five that do not are Blackreach seams that hand out a
  levelled list of gems rather than one item. Those five are listed in the
  json under skipped rather than quietly dropped, because a levelled list is
  not something the server can hand somebody as one thing.

  Read only. It touches nothing in the game folder and nothing on the VPS,
  and it proves that with a listing of the folder before and after.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\dev\Build-OreTable.ps1
    .\scripts\dev\Build-OreTable.ps1 -Data 'C:\Thornswood\Game\Data'
    .\scripts\dev\Build-OreTable.ps1 -NoInstall
    .\scripts\dev\Build-OreTable.ps1 -JsOut "$env:TEMP\ores.js"

  Exit code 1 if a vein's ore does not resolve to a record, if an ore has no
  value to rank it by, if the game folder changed under it, or if any other
  check below fails. Nothing is written unless every check passed.

                         name and after a property's type byte
    int16  object format 1 puts a form id first in an object property,
                         2 puts it last. Everything in this build is 2
    uint16 how many scripts
    then, per script:
      wstring name (a uint16 length and that many characters, no terminator)
      [uint8 status, version 4 and up]
      uint16 how many properties
      then, per property:
        wstring name
        uint8  type: 1 object, 2 string, 3 int32, 4 float, 5 bool,
               11 to 15 the arrays of those
        [uint8 status, version 4 and up]
        the value, whose length the type decides

  Object properties are the ones that matter here and they are eight bytes:
  two unused, a two byte alias index, and the four byte form id, in that order
  when the object format is 2. Everything else is stepped over by length.

  Returns a list of @{ Name = script name; Props = @{ property name = form id } }
  and throws on anything it cannot step over, because a VMAD half read is a
  table with the wrong ore in it.
