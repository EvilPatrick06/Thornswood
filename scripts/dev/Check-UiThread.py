Check-UiThread.py

Finds, and offers to fix, every place the launcher touches the window from a
background thread.

WHY

A playtester's launcher said, on 21 September:

    Could not check profile 1893288986 in with thornswood.net: The calling
    thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns it

on a check in that had SUCCEEDED. Shell.CheckIn runs on a ThreadPool thread. Its
success line called Log(), which writes txtStatus.Text straight at a WPF object,
so it threw; the catch below it reported the throw with PresenceLog, which does
go through the Dispatcher and therefore worked. The launcher told somebody it had
failed to do the thing it had just done.

WHY A SIMPLER SCAN DOES NOT FIND IT, and this is the whole reason this file
exists rather than a grep. The bad call is not inside the delegate:

    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(delegate {
        foreach (int id in ids) CheckIn(id);     <- the delegate
    });
    ...
    static void CheckIn(int id) { ... Log(...) ... }   <- the call is in here

Anything that only reads the delegate's own braces sees nothing. The first
version of this check did exactly that, was run against the version that HAS the
bug, and reported nothing, which is the only reason it was not believed.

So this follows calls out of the delegate, --depth of them, one by default.

WHAT COUNTS AS SAFE. A call inside a Dispatcher.Invoke or Dispatcher.BeginInvoke
block is already on the right thread, and so is one in a method that asks
CheckAccess() first, which is what SafeLog does. Log itself is not reported:
touching the window is its whole job, and the fault is calling it from the wrong
thread rather than its own body.

WHAT IT TOOK TO MAKE IT WORTH READING, because a scan that cries wolf is worse
than no scan. It reported 249 places to begin with and one of them was real. In
order:

  249 -> the closure had no end, so a shared helper seeded once made most of a
         WPF launcher background code. Depth is bounded now.
   15 -> it seeded from the raw delegate body, including the Dispatcher block
         at the end of it where the UI work correctly lives.
   14 -> it read 'if (' and 'foreach (' as calls.
   14 -> new Thread(Loop) has no braces, so the brace search ran forward into
         the next unrelated block and swallowed it. Bounded to the call's own
         brackets.
    1 -> and the last one: methods were keyed by NAME, so seeding Downgrade.Run,
         which really is on a thread, dragged in Shell.Run, a different method
         in a different class, and thirteen of its perfectly good Log calls with
         it. An unqualified call in C# resolves inside its own class, so that is
         how they are looked up now.

One finding on the version that has the bug, at every depth, and nothing at all
on the version without it. That is the only reason to believe it.

WHAT IT FIXES. One thing, mechanically: Log( -> PresenceLog( on a background
path, which is the same line put through the Dispatcher. Anything else it finds,
a control assigned to directly, is printed and left alone, because there is no
one right way to move that and a script guessing is worse than a person reading.

Usage:
    python scripts/dev/Check-UiThread.py
    python scripts/dev/Check-UiThread.py --fix
    python scripts/dev/Check-UiThread.py --depth 3
    python scripts/dev/Check-UiThread.py --app <folder>     (to check it catches things)

Exit code 1 when anything is found and not fixed.

    HOW FAR TO FOLLOW, AND WHY NOT ALL THE WAY.

    Following every call to the end was tried first and it is useless: it reports
    248 places, nearly all of them page builders like BuildDiag and BuildNews
    that only ever run on the window's thread. The reason is that a widely used
    helper gets seeded once and then everything IT calls is background too, and
    within three hops that is most of a WPF launcher.

    A regex cannot tell a method called on the pool path from the same method
    called on the window's thread a page later, so the closure cannot be made
    sound. What it can be is SHALLOW and honest: one hop finds the real fault,
    because a background delegate that does work calls the method that does it.
    CheckIn is exactly that shape and is what this was written for.

    So depth is a knob with a default of 1 and the trade written next to it.
    Deeper finds more and means more of it is wrong; this says what it looked at
    rather than implying it looked everywhere.
