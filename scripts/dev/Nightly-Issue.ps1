  Nightly-Issue.ps1

  Keeps one issue on the board for a failing nightly, and closes it the
  night the checks pass. Run by .github/workflows/nightly.yml as its last
  step, with GH_TOKEN, REPO and RUN set:

      .\scripts\dev\Nightly-Issue.ps1 -Result failure
      .\scripts\dev\Nightly-Issue.ps1 -Result success

  failure  the open "Nightly checks failed" issue gets a comment with the
           date and the run; with none open, one is opened.
  success  every open "Nightly checks failed" issue is closed, with a
           comment naming the green run, so nobody closes it by hand.

  WHY (issues #905 and #1120). On 29 September the step this replaces read
  only the first page of open issues, missed #905 (open since the 28th) once
  more than a hundred issues were open, and opened #1120 beside it. #1155
  made that step read every page; this also collapses any duplicates that
  are already open (the oldest is kept, the rest are closed pointing to it,
  whichever way the night went), and closes the issue the first night the
  checks pass. Until now each body said "close this once the nightly run is
  green again" and waited for a person, so a fixed nightly stayed on the
  board as a failure. A pull request is an issue to this API, and is
  skipped.

  The token is the workflow's own GITHUB_TOKEN (issues: write). Nothing
  here prints it.

  tests\test-nightly-issue.ps1 runs this against a stand-in GitHub.
