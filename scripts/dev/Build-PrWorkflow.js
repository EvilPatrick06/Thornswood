// #1306 (Patrick, 11 Oct 2026, option C): a pull request builds on GitHub's
// hosted windows-latest runner, in a file of its own,
// .github/workflows/build-pr.yml, and build.yml keeps a push to main and a
// manual run. The VPS fallback both had went at the flip (#4983).
//
// build-pr.yml is GENERATED from build.yml so the two can never test
// different things. Edit build.yml, then run:
//
//     node scripts/dev/Build-PrWorkflow.js
//
// With --check it writes nothing and exits 1 if build-pr.yml is stale;
// tests/test-1306-pr-workflow.js runs that in the Launcher builds check.

    check as passed. While the box built there were two builds and either
    could be skipped; since #4983 there is one, and this passes only when it
    succeeded, so a skipped or cancelled build still cannot merge. Since
    31 Oct 2026 the gate runs in shares beside it, in the job "gate", and
    this needs both: a matrix job's result is success only when every share
    succeeded.
