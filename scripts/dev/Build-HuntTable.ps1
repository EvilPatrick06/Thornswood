  Build-HuntTable.ps1

  Builds game\data\hunts.json: the table the server needs to answer a carcass.
  Nothing in it is typed from memory. It is read out of the NPC_ records of
  this build on this machine.

  WHY THERE IS ANYTHING TO BUILD

  classes.md gives the hunter one verb: loot an animal body, and everyone else
  walks past the carcass. The server cannot do that today because it has no way
  to say which bodies are animals and no idea what a body is worth. Both of
  those are in the records and this reads them.

  What the server can already tell about a body was read out of the fork at
  C:\Thornswood-Dev\skymp rather than assumed:
    - mp.get(refrId, 'type') is the string 'MpActor' for anything that is an
      actor and 'MpObjectReference' for a chest, a door, a plant or an ore
      vein. See skymp5-server/cpp/addon/property_bindings/TypeBinding.cpp.
      That is how a body is told from a chest and from a door.
    - mp.get(refrId, 'isDead') is true for a corpse. IsDeadBinding does
      GetFormAt<MpActor>, which THROWS for anything that is not an actor, so
      the type has to be checked first and every read wrapped.
    - mp.get(refrId, 'baseDesc') gives the NPC_ record, which is the key of
      this table.
    - mp.get(refrId, 'inventory') gives what the body is carrying, and the
      pelt and the meat ARE in there. This said the opposite until 20
      September, when it was read instead of assumed: MpActor::Kill ends with
      AddDeathItem (MpActor.cpp:1348), which calls EvaluateDeathItem, which
      follows TPLT through espm::NPC_::UseTraits exactly as this script does,
      runs LeveledListUtils::EvaluateListRecurse on the INAM record and adds
      every result to the dead actor's own inventory. The server resolves the
      levelled list; the client does not.
    - Nobody can reach that inventory, which is why this table exists anyway.
      ProcessActivateNormal does nothing at all for an NPC_ base: it is not
      pickable, not a DOOR, not a CONT, not an ACTI and not a FURN, so it
      falls through every branch and no container is ever sent. The client
      blocks the press as well, in objectReferenceEx.ts, which calls
      blockActivation(true) for FormType.NPC. And RespawnWithDelay wipes the
      corpse inventory before it stands the animal back up. So the engine's
      roll is made and thrown away unseen, and the row this script writes is
      what actually reaches a hunter's pack. The gamemode's mp.onActivate
      fires first either way and returning false blocks the default.
    - Every dead actor stands back up. RespawnWithDelay is called for every
      death by DeathEvent::OnFireSuccess and waits ChangeForm().spawnDelay,
      which is 25.0f unless something sets it. gamemode.js sets it to
      HUNT_TUNING.bodySeconds for the bases in this table, so the window a
      hunter has to press a body is that number rather than twenty five
      seconds, and the same reference can be killed again after it.

  WHICH SUBRECORD NAMES THE RACE, AND HOW THAT WAS PROVED

  It is RNAM, four bytes, a form id. It was not taken on trust. Every
  subrecord of every NPC_ record in Skyrim.esm was counted first, the way
  Build-HarvestTable.ps1 counted PFIG. That is 5118 records, and six tags are
  on every one of them and are four bytes wide: RNAM, NAM6, NAM7, NAM8 and
  CNAM, with DATA on all 5118 at a length of zero. Of those:
    - RNAM resolves to a RACE record for all 8283 NPC_ records in this build,
      every time, with 179 distinct races used out of the 203 the load order
      defines.
    - CNAM resolves to a CLAS record 8283 times out of 8283 and to a RACE
      record not once, so CNAM is the class and not the race.
    - NAM6 and NAM7 are not form ids at all. Read as floats they are 1.0 on
      8054 records with a spread of 0.8 to 1.3, and 50, 10, 0, 1 and 100, which
      is height and weight.
    - NAM8 is 0 to 3, a small number rather than a form id.
  This run counts the same things again and fails if any of it stops being
  true, so the proof is in the run and not only in this header.

  THE TRAP IN RNAM, WHICH COST THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THIS TABLE

  Reading RNAM straight off the record is wrong for more than a thousand of
  them. An NPC that takes its traits from a template carries an RNAM anyway and
  that RNAM is a placeholder: 1175 records in this build have RNAM pointing at
  FoxRace and 1164 of those are templated. Among them are GuardHjaalmarchSons
  and LvlBanditBoss, which a naive read calls foxes. Measured on this build,
  the naive read calls 1084 people animals that the traits chain does not.

  So the race is followed: ACBS holds a sixteen bit template flags field at
  offset 18 and its lowest bit is Use Traits. When that bit is set and TPLT is
  there, the race AND the death item both come from the template, because both
  sit on the Traits tab in the Creation Kit. A template can be another NPC_ or
  it can be an LVLN, a levelled list of NPCs, and an LVLN is followed to every
  leaf in it.

  WHICH NPCs ARE ANIMALS, AND HOW THE RULE WAS FOUND

  A hunter takes meat and hide off a carcass and does not skin a bandit, so
  the split has to be programmatic. Three candidates were tested on this build
  and two of them were thrown out on the numbers:
    - THE VOICE TYPE, VTCK. It separates nothing. Of the NPCs that are their
      own traits, 191 of 199 animals carry a voice type and 4552 of 4694
      people do.
    - THE NPC FLAGS in ACBS. Every one of the twenty bits in use was counted
      on both sides. The best of them, 0x10, is set on 160 of 199 animals and
      on 4044 of 4694 people. Not one bit tells them apart.
    - THE RACE'S OWN KEYWORDS, which do. Every RACE record carries KWDA, and
      the vocabulary in it is ActorTypeAnimal, ActorTypeCreature,
      ActorTypeNPC, ActorTypeUndead, ActorTypeDaedra, ActorTypeDragon,
      ActorTypeDwarven and ActorTypeTroll. 72 races carry ActorTypeAnimal and
      38 carry ActorTypeNPC, and NOT ONE RACE CARRIES BOTH. The split is a
      split, and this run fails if that ever stops being true.

  So an NPC is an animal when the race at the end of its traits chain carries
  ActorTypeAnimal. On this build that is 434 NPC_ records. Spot checked by
  name, the animal races are fox, wolf, deer and elk, dog and husky, horse,
  hare, chicken, skeever, mudcrab, chaurus and chaurus hunter, goat, frostbite
  spider, cow, troll and snow troll, slaughterfish, sabre cat and snowy sabre
  cat, mammoth, horker, bear, cave bear and snow bear, netch, boar and ash
  hopper. The people are the Nords, Imperials, Bretons, Redguards, elves,
  Argonians, Khajiit, Forsworn and the rest, and none of them are in the table.
  Draugr, dragons, dwarven automata, atronachs and daedra are not animals
  either: they carry ActorTypeUndead, ActorTypeDragon, ActorTypeDwarven or
  ActorTypeDaedra and no ActorTypeAnimal, so a hunter walks past them the same
  way everybody walks past a bandit.

  19 NPCs draw their traits from a list that mixes animals with people or with
  undead, so what they are cannot be known before they spawn. They are left out
  and listed in the json under skipped rather than guessed at.

  WHAT EACH ONE GIVES, AND WHAT HAD TO BE THROWN OUT TO GET IT

  The yield is INAM, the death item, a form id pointing at a levelled list.
  Every animal in this build points at one of 40 lists and every one of them is
  an LVLI, so the list has to be resolved rather than priced as a thing.

  Resolving it whole does not work, and that is measured rather than feared.
  DeathItemHorse holds Horse Meat and Horse Hide and then LootSmallTreasure10,
  which is the same treasure list a chest draws from: gold, garnets, amethysts,
  rubies, silver rings. Flattened whole, a horse is worth a 200 gold ruby and
  the table ranks it above a mammoth. Two ways of telling the treasure from the
  body were tried and thrown out: LootSmallTreasure10 is pointed at by 33
  lists and all 33 are death items, so the referrer count says nothing, and at
  the item level the death items of people reach 4918 items including every
  enchanted cuirass in the game, so that says nothing either.

  WHAT WORKS IS WHAT THE BODY GIVES FOR CERTAIN. A levelled list carries LVLD,
  one byte, the chance of giving nothing. A sublist with a chance of nothing in
  it is a chance and not a yield, so this follows the death item into its
  sublists only while that byte is zero. Every treasure list under an animal is
  gated: LootSmallTreasure10 gives nothing 90 times in a hundred, the boar's
  gold list 75, its potion list 85, LootImperialLuck and
  LootPerkGoldenTouchChange 100.

  The rule admits 50 distinct items across the 40 lists and every single one of
  them is part of a body: pelts and hides, meat and venison, tusks, chitin,
  claws, teeth, an eye, venom, jelly, fat, scales. Not one coin, gem, ring,
  potion or soul gem survives it. That is the check that says the rule is
  right, and this run prints the 50 every time so the next person can see it
  for themselves.

  Four things are lost to it and they are named here rather than buried: the
  antlers off a deer (LItemAntlersLarge50 and LItemAntlersSmall50, half the
  time), the horn off a goat (BYOHLItemHornGoat50, half the time), the eggs off
  a chaurus (DeathItemChaurusEggs25, a quarter of the time) and the whole of
  the Solstheim boar, whose death item is six sublists and no item at all, so
  the boar has nothing certain to give and is skipped. Every sublist dropped is
  printed with its chance, every run.

  Where the price sits in a record is read the way the harvest table reads it
  and for the same proved reasons: an INGR, MISC, ARMO, WEAP, SLGM or KEYM
  carries the value as the first four bytes of DATA, and an ALCH carries the
  weight in DATA and the value at the front of ENIT.

  WHEN A BASE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE BODY

  58 of the animals in the table take their traits from an LVLN and so could be
  one of several bodies. These are not an edge case: LvlAnimalForestPredator,
  LvlBearAll, LvlSabreCatAll, LvlElk, LvlMudcrab and the rest are what is
  actually standing in the world. The server cannot know which body a spawn
  became, because the base it reads is still the levelled record. The count is
  of race and death item PAIRS, so LvlElk is in it for being a male or a female
  elk even though both of them give venison and a deer hide; counted by the
  death item alone it is 48.

  So the row takes the LEAST of what that base can be, by the best thing the
  body gives. A base that can be a wolf or a bear is a wolf: the rank never
  asks more than the cheapest body on the list, so nobody is locked out of the
  commonest animals in Skyrim on the chance the spawn rolled a bear, and the
  produce never promises a bear pelt off a wolf. Every one of them is listed in
  the json with what else it could have been.

  The race and the death item are carried through the chain as PAIRS and not as
  two lists, so the row that takes the cheaper body takes that body's name with
  it. Kept apart, LvlBearAll would have been free to pick up the bear's name
  and the cave bear's pelt, which is two animals in one row.

  WHAT THE ANIMAL IS CALLED

  The NPC record's own FULL first, so Barbas, Karinda and Lord Tusk are called
  what they are called. 199 of the 361 animals in this build have no FULL at
  all, and they are not the obscure ones: EncWolf, EncBanditWolf_Indoor,
  WhiterunPlayerHorse and MQ101FrostbiteSpider are what somebody actually walks
  up to. Falling back to the editor id the way the harvest table does would put
  'Skinning the dunBloodletThrone_LvlWolf takes an Advanced Hunter' in front of
  a person, so the fallback is the RACE record's own FULL, which is read out of
  a record like everything else here and reads Wolf, Horse, Frostbite Spider,
  Deer, Rabbit. On this build that is every one of the 199 and the run fails if
  a row is ever left with an editor id where the name goes.

  WHAT IT COMES TO ON THIS BUILD

  336 animals in the table and 99 left out and listed: 43 that are not a body
  to dress (the spirits, the spell actors and the hidden actors NOT A BODY TO
  DRESS in the knobs reads off the records, and the test netch, issue #1808),
  50 with no death item anywhere in their traits chain, which is mostly the
  audio templates and the cut Dragonborn spiders, 5 boars and one Creation Club
  creature. The ranks come out 147 novice, 140 advanced, 43 expert and 6
  master. Measured on 5 October against the Main install's load order.

  Read only. It touches nothing in the game folder and nothing on the VPS, and
  it proves that by fingerprinting the game folder before and after and failing
  if anything moved.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\dev\Build-HuntTable.ps1

    .\scripts\dev\Build-HuntTable.ps1 -PluginList 'C:\Thornswood\Profile\OwnGame\plugins.txt'
    .\scripts\dev\Build-HuntTable.ps1 -NoInstall

  Exit code 1 if a plugin in the load order is missing, if a localised plugin
  has no string table, if an NPC_ record has no RNAM or an RNAM that is not
  four bytes, if an RNAM names no RACE record, if a race carries both the
  animal keyword and the person keyword, if no animals are found at all, if a
  yield item names no record in the build, if an item has no readable price, if
  the novice rung is empty, if a name in the NOT A BODY TO DRESS knobs is not in
  the load order or a base in LEFT_OUT is not an animal, if an animal's scripts
  cannot be read, or if the game folder changed underneath it.
  Nothing is written unless every check passed.

# Added 20 September, after the table was found calling chickens rabbits. The
# name used to be the NPC record's own FULL and then, if it had none, the RACE
# record's FULL. Both of those are read here; the hop between them was missing.
#
# WHAT IT COST, read out of the records rather than off a wiki:
# SnowShodFarmChicken (fa6d9:Skyrim.esm) has no FULL of its own, template flags
# 0x1f9f, which has 0x0080 set, and TPLT 0a91a0, EncChicken, whose FULL is
# 'Chicken'. dunTransmogrifyChicken (10929f:Skyrim.esm) is the same at 0x1fbf.
# Vanilla ChickenRace (a919d:Skyrim.esm) carries a FULL of its own and that FULL
# is the string 'Rabbit', which was read out of Skyrim.esm and the string table
# in Skyrim - Interface.bsa. So the race fallback answered for both records and
# the built table said 'Rabbit', along with GraniteHillChicken
# (e0c0:aaaGraniteHill.esp) and ZWJ_Polymorph17_Chicken
# (ea865:ZIA_Complete Pack.esp). A hunter over a dead farm chicken read 'You take
# 1 Chicken Breast off the Rabbit.' The nameless check further down never caught
# it, because the race did supply a name; it only catches a row with no name
# anywhere.
#
# The walk is the base data bit's own and is separate from the traits walk above,
# because they are separate bits that happen to point at the same TPLT: a record
# may take its race and death item from a template and keep its own name, or keep
# its own race and take the name. Each is followed on its own bit.
#
# AN LVLN ONLY ANSWERS WHEN ITS LEAVES AGREE. A template can be a levelled list
# of NPCs, and what the spawn became is not knowable here, so a list whose leaves
# are called two different things gives no name at all and the record falls
# through to its own FULL and then to the race, which is the same 'the least this
# can be' rule the yield is picked under. A list of chickens still answers
# 'Chicken'.
