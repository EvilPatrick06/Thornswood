Audit-PapyrusEvents.py

Which scripts in the load order can still do anything under Thornswood, and
which mods are only their records.

WHY IT EXISTS

On 20 September Patrick reported that "a lot of the mods in our list are just
straight up not present in the game". It is not the load order: every plugin
loads, and the ones that look missing are light plugins the load order file
cannot see (entry 168). They are loaded and doing nothing, because the client
blocks Papyrus events, and from a chair that is indistinguishable from not
being installed. Entry 323 asks for a decision per event, which ones the server
could allow, and for the mods that only work through blocked events to come
out of the collection. Neither can be decided without knowing which events the
collection's scripts wait on, and nothing in this repo had ever read a .pex.
This does.

THE RULE is the fork's, and it is records\\papyrus-events.json, which
scripts\\dev\\PapyrusEventList.js reads out of the fork and
tests\\test-papyrus-event-list.js holds to the fork at its pin (issue #503).
This keeps no copy of it. A script fires only where both halves let it:

  On each person's machine. skymp5-client turns the blocker on, and
  skyrim-platform's FridaHooks.cpp (OnSendEventEnter) blanks every event name
  but the ones the record lets through (OnUpdate at f1e18a4a), unless a script
  on the same object carries one of the exempt names (SKI_ something, compared
  with case, and defaultDisableHavokOnLoad, without). A script that runs there
  runs on that one machine.

  On the server. Its own Papyrus machine attaches a script only to a placed
  reference (the reference's record and its base record), only when its
  storage holds the script (the built in scripts, data\\scripts and any
  archive the "archives" setting names) and nothing drops it by name, and
  sends it only the event names the record lists. Quests, aliases, dialogue,
  packages, perks, scenes and magic effects get nothing there. One rule this
  does not apply, and the report says so: with disableVanillaScriptsInExterior
  on, a reference below 05000000 in an exterior keeps only Sweet* scripts.

Each plugin gets a verdict on each half ("status" for the machine, "server"
for the server), and "firesNowhere" when it has scripts and neither half runs
any of them.

WHAT COUNTS AS AN EVENT. A .pex does not mark an event as different from a
function, so this takes the game's own word for it. A native script declares
the events native code will send it as empty functions: Form.pex declares
OnUpdate and OnMenuOpen, ObjectReference.pex OnActivate, PO3_Events_Form.pex
OnQuestStageChange. So every empty, non-native, non-global function in a
script that has native functions is an event name. Add OnInit, which the VM
sends to every script and no script declares, and every callback a script
names in RegisterForModEvent. Leave out onBeginState and onEndState: every
compiled script carries them and GotoState calls them, so they start nothing.
Anything else a script calls OnSomething, SkyUI's OnPageReset for one, is an
ordinary function called by another script, and this hook does not touch it.

A script handles an event when it, or a script it extends, has a body for it
in any state. The nearest definition wins, so a child that declares an event
empty has switched its parent's off.

A TIMER HAS TO BE STARTED. OnUpdate only arrives after RegisterForUpdate or
RegisterForSingleUpdate. For every script that handles OnUpdate this follows
the script's calls to itself from each event and lists the events that reach a
registration. The timer is counted as never starting, rather than as working,
only when all three hold: every event that reaches a registration is blocked;
no script anywhere calls in, by name, to a function on the way to one; and
nothing else the plugin attaches registers a timer on another object, the way
QuickLootIE's load alias starts its maintenance quest. Anything less certain
than that is counted as able to run.

WHAT IT READS. The five masters and plugins.txt, masters first as the engine
sorts them. The VMAD of every record in every plugin: the scripts on each
record and on each quest alias, and the fragment script on quests, dialogue,
scenes, packages and perks. The last plugin to define a record decides its
scripts, and a script is credited to the plugin that first put it there, so a
patch carrying a vanilla script forward does not make it the patch's. Scripts
come from Data\\Scripts first, then from the archives, a later one winning, as
the game reads them.

WHAT IT DOES NOT KNOW, and says so rather than guess.
  Fragments. Quest stage, dialogue, scene, package and perk fragments are
  functions the engine calls by name, Fragment_0 and on, not events. Whether
  that call passes through the hook has not been checked, so they are counted
  and not judged.
  Whether a given event reaches SendEvent at all. The rule above blanks what
  passes through it. Nothing here was measured in the game.
  A placed reference and its base object are one object in the game, so a
  defaultDisableHavokOnLoad on a reference unblocks its base's scripts there.
  This judges each record and alias on its own.
  A timer another script starts, by calling into this one or registering it.
  An archive named after no plugin is counted as loaded, which is right for
  the Skyrim - ones the ini lists and may be wrong for a stray one.

Read only. It writes nothing unless --json names a file.
