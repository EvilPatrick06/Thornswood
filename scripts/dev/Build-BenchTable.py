Build-BenchTable.py

Works out, for every crafting bench in the load order, which furniture in the
world IS that bench and who can make anything at it, and writes both answers
into game\\gamemode.js as generated blocks.

WHY

Patrick, 21 September: "all of the vanilla tables should not let you open them to
craft so people don't get around our system", and then, asked which of two
readings he meant: "well some benches dont have our recipes though and yes if you
cant yse it you shouldnt be able to open it".

So the rule is one rule and it covers both cases he named. A bench opens if there
is something you can make at it and does not open if there is not. A forge opens
for a smith and not for a farmer. A bench that holds nothing this server lets
anybody make does not open for anyone, which is the case he raised: there are
benches in Skyrim that none of our recipes sit on.

WHY THE SERVER CANNOT ALREADY ANSWER THIS. mp.onActivate is handed the furniture
reference and its BASE. A recipe names its bench by KEYWORD, in its BNAM. Nothing
in the shipped gamemode joins those two, because nothing has ever needed to: the
craft gate runs after a craft, when the recipe is already known. Refusing to OPEN
one has to happen before any recipe exists, from the base alone. That join is the
first block below.

WHAT IT READS. game\\data\\recipes.json, which Build-RecipeTable.ps1 already wrote and
which carries the bench, owner, half and rank of all 3,439 owned rows and the
bench of all 1,679 unowned ones. Then the FURN and ACTI records of every plugin
in the load order, for the keywords those benches are named by. It is Python
rather than PowerShell because Build-RecipeTable takes five minutes to walk this
load order and this takes a few seconds, and because Build-Backdrop.py,
Sync-LoadOrder.py and Audit-ArmorSlots.py are already here.

WHAT IT WRITES, between markers, the way the recipe table is written:

    BENCH_BY_BASE   furniture base descriptor -> the bench keyword it carries.
                    This is the join the server has never had.
    BENCH_ACCESS    bench keyword descriptor -> what can be made there:
                      name    the keyword's editor id, for the log and nothing else
                      rows    every recipe at the bench that reaches the server,
                              by descriptor. The gate opens the bench for
                              somebody craftAnswer allows one of them, so the
                              door and the craft ask the same question.
                      halves  each half that owns anything here, against the LOWEST
                              rank at which they own something. The gate's
                              refusal names them, and it is the door for the two
                              menu stations, which hold no rows.
                      shut    only on a bench in SHUT_BENCHES below: the sentence
                              the gate says instead of opening it, for anybody.
                              Such a bench has no rows and no halves.

No bench opens for everybody (#3080, NO BENCH IS OPEN FOR ITS OWN SAKE below).

A bench with no owned recipes and no unowned ones is not in BENCH_ACCESS at all,
and the gate refuses a base whose bench it cannot find. That is the "some benches
dont have our recipes" case, and refusing is what was asked for.

Read only apart from the two blocks it writes into gamemode.js.

# NO BENCH IS OPEN FOR ITS OWN SAKE (#3080).
#
# Patrick, 21 October, on the report page: "An open bench opens only for
# somebody with at least one recipe there that they may make." And in the
# thread the same evening: "the forge, tanning rack, and loom should be ones
# that SMiths, and Tailors use", "so they should not be opned to anyone", and
# "make sure the forge tanning rack and loom open to the correct people not just
# that for all".
#
# Until then the professions page named five benches open furniture (the
# cookpot, the forge, the tanning rack, the loom and the Aetherium forge) and
# this script opened them for everybody whatever rows they held, so Skyrim's
# crafting menu opened for somebody who could make nothing in it and only the
# pick was refused. There is no such list now. Each bench carries its rows,
# and the gate opens it for somebody craftAnswer allows at least one of them:
# the same answer, row for row, that the craft itself gets and that hides the
# rest of the menu (handRecipesHidden). A race's own gear, a roll's gear and a
# rank are all in that answer, so no door can be wider than the craft.
#
# No bench opens for everybody. Patrick, 21 October, asked whether the smelter
# should close as well: "yes any bench or thing you can craft or do anything
# Proffesion or Trade related", "Proffesion, Sub-Proffesion or class". A row
# nobody owns (the forge's rings, the smelter's ores, the tanning rack's fur
# plate) is made by whoever the bench opens for, and a bench that holds only
# such rows (the Hearthfire building benches) opens for nobody: there is
# nothing anybody can make there that is their trade.


# THE BENCHES NOTHING CAN BE MADE AT, WHOEVER YOU ARE (#1384).
#
# Tempering is cut. A piece is mended with a repair kit (docs/systems/durability.md),
# and the 1809 temper rows are in docs/systems/cut-items.md, held so an event can
# bring one back. Every recipe these two benches carry is a temper: 471 owned rows
# at the sharpening wheel and 1334 at the armour table are all fires: false, and
# the 11 rows nobody owns at the armour table are tempers too. The engine throws
# every recipe at either bench out before a craft (CraftService RecipeItemsMatch,
# isTemper), and the gamemode refuses one that gets through (recipelessCraft).
#
# Until #1384 this script still opened both. The wheel's temper rows counted as
# Edgewright and Woodwright work, and the armour table was open furniture on the
# premise "Tempering never reaches the server", which stopped being true when
# the refusal went in. So Skyrim's crafting menu opened and listed every piece
# you could temper, and only the pick was refused. A bench here is written shut,
# whatever rows it holds: no rows, no
# halves, and the sentence the gate says instead of opening it. It stays in
# BENCH_BY_BASE, because recipelessCraft and TWO_HANDS still name it. The
# sentence is the gamemode's temper refusal, word for word, and
# tests/test-1384-shut-benches.js holds the two equal. Taking a bench out of
# here, with the cut list, is how a temper comes back for an event.
