.SYNOPSIS
  Prints the harnesses the build check runs on every pull request: every tests\test-*.js and tests\test-*.ps1 that tests\gate-excluded.txt does not name, one a line, in name order.

.DESCRIPTION
  Issue #3009. The gate list was a hand-kept array in build.yml, copied into
  build-pr.yml, and every pull request that put a harness on the gate
  appended to its end. Any two of them edited the same lines in both files
  and conflicted: 12 merges touched build.yml between midnight and 6:30 AM
  UTC on 21 Oct 2026, and one pull request conflicted on the list four times.
  A conflicted pull request gets no build at all.

  So the list is read from the files when the build runs. A new harness is
  on the gate the moment it is in tests\, and touches no shared line. One
  comes off the gate by a line in tests\gate-excluded.txt, "name  reason",
  kept in name order so two pull requests adding lines add them in different
  places. Why a harness exists, and why it is on the gate, is in its own
  header.

  The build's "Run the gate harnesses" step calls this in its own process:

      $gate = @(& .\scripts\dev\Gate-Harnesses.ps1)

  It stops with exit 1, and runs nothing, on a gate-excluded.txt line with no
  reason, one naming a file that is not in tests\, a name on two lines, lines
  out of name order, or no harness left to run. Each fault is printed as a
  GitHub error on its line.

  tests\test-gate-list.ps1 runs this against planted folders.
  Read only.

.PARAMETER Root
  The repository whose harnesses are listed. The one this script is in,
  unless a test points it at a copy.
