  Check-Words.ps1

  The writing rules in Developer-Guide.md, checked on every file people read instead of hoped for; each hit names the file, the line and the rule.

  WHAT IT READS. Every file whose whole point is text for people:
    - every Markdown file in the repository, apart from lore\ (in-world
      writing, not operational text), docs\archive\ (dated snapshots, kept as
      they were) and the engine submodule;
    - the launcher's window (launcher/ui.xaml; its Help page went with #3146),
      the bot's channel posts (bot/content.py), the site's public pages
      (site/public/*.html) and the read me every installer carries
      (installer/READ ME FIRST.txt). The voice service serves no page since
      #1822, so it has none to read.
  Not the code files (the gamemode, the overlays, the rest of the launcher): a
  word check there fires on identifiers, engine calls like player.moveto and
  Skyrim's own record names, and those are not text for people.
  Developer-Guide.md says which rules no machine checks.

  THE RULES, each by the name a hit carries:
    em-dash          no em dashes anywhere written for people (Words)
    banned-word      never the word player (Words)
    old-owner        the owner is Patrick, never the old name (Words)
    open-alpha       never a closed playtest: an alpha, open by application (#428)
    placeholder      no placeholders: TODO, TBD, FIXME, lorem ipsum (Words)
    signer-name      the name on the code signing certificate is written in
                     one place, ExpectedSigner in launcher\app\Updater.cs,
                     which the launcher checks every update against. A page
                     says "the name on the signing certificate", or names the
                     profile, ThornswoodRelease (issue #1052)
    names-person     README.md and the six component READMEs name nobody:
                     operational documents are losing names, and problems go
                     to the Discord or the report page, never to one person
                     (tests\test-component-readmes.js, tests\test-repo-docs.js)

  WHEN A LINE HAS TO SAY IT. Developer-Guide.md has to name the word it bans,
  and a document that quotes something that went out quotes it as it was.
  Those lines go in scripts\dev\Check-Words.allow.txt with the reason, one per
  line. An allowance that matches nothing any more is itself a hit, so the
  list cannot quietly grow stale.

  MEASURED 24 September, when this was first written: eleven hits over the
  first ten files it read. MEASURED 29 September (issue #460), when it grew to
  every Markdown file and the public pages: six more, in the installer setup
  README (a name, the one that had held test-component-readmes.js red since
  #1017), the required data README, the script index, the site's gallery page
  and Developer-Guide.md, plus two lines that quote on purpose.

  The em dash is built from its code point, [char]0x2014, plus its HTML
  entities, and never pasted in, so this file's own encoding cannot decide
  whether the check works. Measured while writing it first: the first draft
  spelled it as a regex escape, the tool that wrote the file turned that
  escape into the character itself, and Windows PowerShell 5.1, reading this
  file as ANSI, then found none of the six em dashes that were there. So the
  pattern has no escape to lose, and test-check-words.ps1 fails on any byte
  in this file that is not plain ASCII. Each file is read as UTF-8 on
  purpose: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a file with no byte order mark as
  ANSI, and would never see an em dash in one. En dashes and hyphens are
  allowed. The word has a boundary on each side, so multiplayer, playtest and
  getPlayer pass.

  Which files: git's own list when -Root is a checkout, so nothing untracked
  on a machine is read; every file under -Root otherwise (the harness's temp
  folder).

  Read only. Each hit prints as ::error file=,line= so GitHub marks the line
  on the pull request, and any hit exits 1. There is no fix mode, which is
  why a Claude may run it.
