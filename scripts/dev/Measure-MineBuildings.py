Measure-MineBuildings.py

Lists every building that holds a placed ore vein, and every building a lock
would shut a vein behind.

WHY

Entry 325 on the To Do List. Two of Patrick's rulings meet at a mine and nobody
has put them side by side yet:

  17 September, the mining design agreed in Discord: "Nobody owns a mine."
  21 September, the property system: "every building in the game is
  claimable, shops and halls and palaces included, so people can lock doors
  and own shops."

Today the second one wins without anybody having chosen it: /claim takes any
building BUILDING_BY_DOOR knows, and a claimed building can be locked. Which of
the two holds is his to say, and this script says nothing about it. What he
needs in front of him to say it is which buildings are actually mines, and a
name is not that. Miner's Barracks has "Mine" in it and no vein, and a cave
called something else can be full of iron. So this answers it from the
plugins, the way the door table was built.

WHAT A MINE IS HERE. A building holding at least one placed reference whose
base is in ORES_BY_BASE. That table is exactly what mineOre lets a person work,
so this counts what the server mines and nothing the server does not.

ON THE WAY IN. A lock keeps people out of a building, and a mine whose veins
are two rooms down is shut just as well by a lock on the first room. So for
every building with a vein, and every worldspace with one behind a building,
this also names the buildings that every road from open ground to it goes
through. The roads come from game\\data\\doors.json, the table BUILDING_BY_DOOR was
generated from, so a building here is the same building /claim would take.

WHAT OPEN GROUND IS. Tamriel and Solstheim, unless --open names others.
Solstheim is on it because the way there is a boat, not a door. Every other
worldspace is one place of its own, because a person walks between its outdoor
cells without a door, and it is measured the way a room is: a worldspace whose
every road in goes through one building is behind that building, as a room two
doors down is. One with a road in that no single building sits on, like
Blackreach and its lifts, is open ground as far as a lock goes. So is one that
no door road joins to Tamriel or Solstheim at all, because people get there by
a spell, a book or a boat and no lock stands on that way; a room reached from
it is measured from it.

The first version counted every outdoor cell in every worldspace as open
ground, and a reviewer measured what that missed on 24 September: Deepwood
Redoubt is the only road into Deepwood Vale and was not listed, Darkfall Cave
is the only road into the Forgotten Vale's 50 veins and was listed as shutting
2, and Frostmere Crypt is the only road into Frostmere Depths.

WHAT IT READS. The plugins in load order, the five masters and then
plugins.txt, last one wins, which is the rule Build-DoorTable.py uses and whose
plugin reader this borrows rather than copies. ORES_BY_BASE, BUILDING_BY_DOOR
and BUILDING_NAME out of game\\gamemode.js. game\\data\\doors.json.

WHAT IT WRITES. Nothing, unless --out names a file, and then that one file. It
changes no rule and touches neither the gamemode nor the claim.
