.SYNOPSIS
  The trace task on the VPS: traces every main build's gate as it runs and
  leaves the map pull requests are held to in each build runner's folder
  (#3114).

.DESCRIPTION
  Not run by hand. scripts\dev\Trace-Gate.ps1 -Install puts it and
  Trace-Gate-Box.ps1 in C:\Thornswood-Trace\task, which only administrators
  can read, and registers the scheduled task Thornswood Gate Trace, which
  runs it as SYSTEM from the box's start, at below normal priority. Windows
  PowerShell 5.1 runs it. -Status says what it is doing and -Uninstall
  takes it off.

  WHY. Patrick chose on 22 Oct 2026 (option A on his page,
  q-3114-map-refresh) to trace every main build, so a pull request's change
  is measured from a map that is never more than a merge or two old: one 2
  merges old ran 48% of the gate's harness time over the last 40 merges, a
  fresh one 33%, one 10 old 89%. Only an administrator can start the trace
  session, and a build runs as its runner's own account, so the build asks
  and this task does it.

  HOW A BUILD ASKS. Through the runner's own folder, <runner>\trace, which
  its account may write (scripts\dev\Run-Gate.ps1 says what each file is).
  The task looks every two seconds in the folders of the build runners
  task.json names (records\build-runners.json when it was installed), and
  in no other:
    ask.json  taken, read as data and deleted. It is refused unless it names
              a run, a full commit, a checkout inside that runner's own _work
              folder that is no link to somewhere else, and a process that
              is running and started when it says; and unless that run was
              never asked for before. The answer goes in answer.json.
    One trace at a time. An ask while one runs is refused, so that build
    runs untraced; unless the process that asked for the running one has
    ended without saying its gate did, which is a main build cancelled by
    the next merge, and then that trace is dropped and the new one starts.
    done.json the gate ended: the start log and the tree are copied into the
              trace's own folder at once, the session is stopped, and a trace
              that lost any event is dropped. Otherwise it is read.
  A trace is also dropped when its build's process ends without done.json,
  and when it runs past 45 minutes. The session's file stops at 12 GB, which
  loses events, so a trace that big is dropped too; a trace starts only with
  20 GB free on C:.

  THE READ. In a process of its own (this script, -Read <folder>) at below
  normal priority, so it takes only what the builds and the game servers
  leave: about ten minutes of one core for a whole gate. One read at a
  time; when more traces are waiting, only the newest is read, since an
  older map is as true and only wider. It keeps only paths inside the
  build's checkout (Trace-Gate-Box.ps1 says how), writes the traces and the
  tree to every build runner's <runner>\gate-map, then latest.json naming
  them, keeps the newest three there, and deletes the trace. gate-map is
  locked so the runner's account may read it and nothing more: a job cannot
  change the map another pull request is held to.

  What it does goes in C:\Thornswood-Trace\task.log, one line a thing, in
  UTC. A trace sees every file name on the box, so it stays in
  C:\Thornswood-Trace\main, which only administrators can read, until it
  is read and deleted.

.PARAMETER Read
  Only the read of one finished trace, in the folder named: what the task
  starts for each one.
