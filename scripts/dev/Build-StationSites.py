Build-StationSites.py

Works out where Thornswood-Content.esp places Thornswood's own stations, the
charcoal kiln, the salt quarry, the beehive and the alchemy lab, from the
plugins, and writes it down in game\\data\\station-sites.json.
scripts\\mods\\Add-ContentRecords.py places them from that table.

WHY (#2553)

Until 16 October the only placed kilns, salt quarries, placed hives and
Thornswood labs were 57 placements salvaged from another server's plugin,
each where that server put it. Patrick, 16 October 2026, A on #2553:
Thornswood measures its own spots for them, the way the woodworking benches
were placed (#516, scripts\\dev\\Build-WoodworkingBenches.py), and the content
plugin places them. The 57 go, and the plugin holds nothing of the other
server's.

WHERE EACH KIND GOES, AND WHY (docs\\systems\\station-placement.md says the
same in prose). The rulebook names what each station is for and who works it;
it names no town. So each kind has one rule, chosen from what the station is
for, and SITES below is that rule worked out. The builder checks each site
against its rule and stops on one that does not follow it.

  kiln     docs\\systems\\professions\\woodworker\\charburner.md: the kiln turns
           firewood, which a woodworker splits at a chopping block, into the
           charcoal every forge burns. So one kiln for each of the nine towns
           with a woodworking bench, outside the town: beside the chopping
           block in the open world (Tamriel, not a walled city's own
           worldspace) nearest that town's forge, among those 1,000 units or
           more from every bench (#2337), within 12,000 units (20,000 for
           Solitude and Markarth). A kiln is the size of Skyrim's smelter,
           and no walled city has that much clear ground by a block; like a
           smelter it may stand among small plants (Patrick, B on #2553).
  salt     docs\\systems\\classes\\miner.md: the salt quarry. Salt comes from
           the sea, so one quarry on the shore of each hold capital that
           stands on the Sea of Ghosts (Solitude, Windhelm, Dawnstar,
           Winterhold), beside the boat drawn up nearest the town: its forge
           for the first three, its smithing anvil for Winterhold, which has
           no forge. The quarry is an ore vein, set into rock the way
           Skyrim's veins are: only where the miner stands needs clear, dry,
           flat ground (Patrick, B on #2553).
  hive    docs\\systems\\classes\\farmer.md: a placed hive is a farmer verb.
           So one hive at each of Skyrim's own named farms (a location Skyrim
           marks as a farm) that has at least 5 crop plots of the farmer's
           table within 2,400 units, the farm claim's circle, of the farm:
           its map marker, or the farmhouse's outside door where that marker
           is inside the house. The hive stands beside the crop plot nearest
           that point.
  lab      docs\\systems\\professions\\alchemist\\physicker.md and injury.md:
           the poultice and the remedy are made only at Thornswood's lab.
           So one lab in the apothecary of each of the nine hold capitals,
           the shop Skyrim marks as a store that has Skyrim's own alchemy lab,
           beside that lab. Winterhold has no apothecary in town, so its lab
           is in the College's Hall of Countenance, beside the lab there.

NO COORDINATE IN HERE IS TYPED FROM THE GAME. Each site's rule gives its
anchors, nearest first: the chopping blocks or boats nearest its town (within
TOWN_REACH), the crop plots nearest its farm, or the labs SITES names. Each is
a reference of Skyrim's or of a mod in the load order that never moves. For
each anchor in turn the builder searches round it, every step units out to
the kind's reach in eight turns of the anchor's own angle, and takes the
nearest clear spot, a turn costing as much as 60 units of distance; the first
anchor with one wins, and the anchors passed over are written down with why.
When no anchor has a clear spot, the site is left out with every anchor tried
and why (skipped in the table), the way the benches skip a town (#516):
nothing is placed where the measure refuses every spot. The point, the height
and the angle come out of the anchor's winning record over the load order.

WHAT HOLDS A SPOT CLEAR, the same measure as the woodworking benches:

  The ground. The station's outline and the place somebody stands to use it
  are sampled every 16 units (32 for the kiln and the quarry, which are four
  times a bench's size). Every sample lies on the winning navmesh of that
  worldspace or cell, within the kind's flat of every other sample (the far
  side sinks that far into a slope, never floats) and within 60 units of the
  anchor's height; on the shore, between the sea and 240 units above it. The
  station stands on the lowest sample. Out of doors every sample lies above
  the water of its cell.

  Nothing in the way. No furniture, container, door, activator, plant, item
  or small static overlaps it (each one's bounds, turned and scaled as it is
  placed) between 6 and 140 units above its floor, and the nearest is at
  least 30 units away. Nor the place somebody stands at any other furniture,
  the way through a door, a woodworking bench the server stands (#516), a
  notice board and its drop box (#2516), or another of these stations. Larger
  statics and anything over 600 units on a side are the navmesh's to answer
  for. Thornswood-Content.esp's own placements of these four stations are not
  obstacles: they are what this places.

  A kiln stands at least 1,000 units from every woodworking bench (#2337).

  The cell. The plugin has to carry the cell a placement stands in, and the
  worldspace of an exterior, copied from Bethesda's own record. That copy
  must change nothing in the game: either a plugin after the content plugin
  carries the same record, so the copy never wins, or the record that wins
  without the content plugin is Bethesda's own, field for field. A spot in a
  cell a mod changes is refused, so the copy never undoes a mod's edit.

WHAT IT READS. The collection's plugins in game\\data\\last-plugin.json's load
order, from --data, and from the repository's Thornswood-Content.esp only the
four station records: their bounds are the stations' outlines. It does not
read Thornswood-Last.esp or Thornswood-WoodworkerTrail.esp, and it checks
that neither places anything. It reads the benches' spots out of
game\\data\\woodworking-benches.json and the boards' out of game\\gamemode.js.

WHAT IT WRITES. game\\data\\station-sites.json: every site's anchor, the spot,
its angle, the ground under it, the nearest solid thing, the cell and
worldspace records the plugin carries and why each copy changes nothing, the
placement's form id, and every plugin read with its size and sha256. It does
not hash Thornswood-Content.esp, which is written from this table.

Read only apart from that file. --check writes nothing and fails when the
table is not what the plugins give now.
