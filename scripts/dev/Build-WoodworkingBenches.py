Build-WoodworkingBenches.py

Works out where the server stands a woodworking bench beside each town's
public forge, from the plugins, and writes it down: game\\data\\
woodworking-benches.json and the WOODWORKING_BENCHES block in the property
block of game\\gamemode.js.

WHY (#516)

Since #2529 Thornswood-Content.esp carries a woodworking bench,
ThornswoodCraftingWoodworkingWorkbench (154e2, keyword 154e1), and 26
recipes moved onto it from the forge: the bows, arrows and bolts of Skyrim,
Dawnguard and Dragonborn, our three fishing poles and the fish trap. No
plugin places that bench anywhere. Patrick, 12 October: our own bench, at
least one in every major hold and in some minor towns. The placement brief
(docs\\systems\\woodworker-bench-placement.md) asks for one beside the
public forge in each hold's capital and in towns with an open-air forge,
never at the charcoal kiln.

NO COORDINATE IN HERE IS TYPED FROM THE GAME. Each site in SITES names a
forge reference and an offset in that forge's own frame: so many units to
its right and in front of where its smith stands, and a turn from the
forge's own angle. The point, the height and the angle are worked out of
the forge's winning record over the whole load order, the way the notice
boards' anchors were (#2516, #2555).

WHAT HOLDS A SPOT CLEAR, measured rather than assumed, and the build stops
on any site that fails it:

  The forge. Its winning record over the load order in
  game\\data\\last-plugin.json, the repository's own Thornswood-Content.esp
  in its place, and the repository's Thornswood-Last.esp and
  Thornswood-WoodworkerTrail.esp after it. It has to be placed furniture
  carrying CraftingSmithingForge, enabled, not deleted, with no enable
  parent, in the worldspace SITES says. The server loads furniture
  (WorldState::AttachEspmRecord) and skips disabled and deleted references.

  The ground. The bench's outline and the place its user stands are sampled
  every 16 units. Every sample has to lie on the winning navmesh of that
  worldspace (NAVM, NVNM), which the game's authors cut around walls,
  buildings, rocks and everything solid, within 16 units of every other
  sample and within 60 of the forge's own height. The bench stands on the
  lowest of them, so its far side sinks a few units into the ground rather
  than any of it floating.

  Nothing in the way. No furniture, container, door, activator, plant, item
  or static smaller than 250 by 250 units may overlap the bench or its
  user's place (each one's object bounds, turned and scaled as it is
  placed), unless it lies wholly below the floor or more than 140 units
  above it, and the nearest of them stands at least 30 units from the
  table. Nor may the place somebody stands at any other bench, or the way
  through any door. A larger static (a building, a wall, a rock), and
  anything over 600 units on a side (a dragon's perch, a pond's water), is
  the navmesh's to answer for: its bounds are a box round all of it and
  would cover the street in front of it.

The bench's shape, from its record and its mesh (_BYOH\\Furniture\\
CraftingWorkbench01.nif): its object bounds run x -72 to 81 and y -10 to 75
in its own frame, and the mesh's one furniture marker sits at its origin
facing +y, so the woodworker stands at the origin and the table is in
front of them. TABLE and USER below are those two areas with a margin.

WHAT IT WRITES

  game\\data\\woodworking-benches.json: each site's forge, its winning
  record and every plugin that touches it, the point and angle, the height
  of the ground under it, the nearest solid thing and how far, and every
  plugin read with its size and sha256 (builtAgainst).
  game\\gamemode.js, between the WOODWORKING_BENCHES markers: the base, and
  for each site its forge, worldspace, point and angle.

Read only apart from those two files. --check writes nothing and fails when
either file is not what the plugins give now. --search <site> prints the
clear spots round that site's forge, nearest first, to choose an offset.
