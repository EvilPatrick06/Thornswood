.SYNOPSIS
  Runs, before a push, the gate harnesses this branch's change can reach,
  from main's nightly map, in a cloud container or on a PC (#5183).

.DESCRIPTION
      pwsh scripts/dev/Check-Change.ps1
      pwsh scripts/dev/Check-Change.ps1 -Body pr-body.md     the PR's test tasks too
      pwsh scripts/dev/Check-Change.ps1 -List                say what would run, run nothing

  WHY. Of the last 100 pull request runs on 31 Oct 2026, 20 failed and 15
  were cancelled by a newer push: a change was pushed, and what it broke was
  learned from the shares, a round trip of six minutes and six Windows jobs
  each time. The same harnesses the shares would run can run here first.

  WHAT IT RUNS. Main's newest nightly map (.github\workflows\gate-map.yml,
  fetched by scripts\dev\Gate-Map.ps1 -Fetch), the same pick the pull
  request's shares make (scripts\dev\Affected-Harnesses.js pick, from the
  traced tree to this checkout's HEAD), and those harnesses through
  scripts\dev\Nightly-Harnesses.ps1, on their own clocks, with the throttle
  this machine's cores allow. So what passes here is what the shares run,
  measured from the same map. On Linux a harness that needs Windows prints
  SKIP for those checks, and the shares run them on Windows.

  With -Body, the pull request's body in a file is checked as its checks
  will: its release note line as "Release note" holds it
  (scripts\dev\Check-PrBody.ps1, #5179), and its test tasks to the bot's
  post rules as "Test tasks in the pull request" holds them
  (bot\pr_tasks.py, #5199), which needs the bot's libraries
  (bot\requirements.txt).

  COMMIT FIRST. The change is HEAD against the traced tree, as on GitHub, so
  edits not yet committed are not part of it; it stops when a tracked file
  has any.

  NO MAP. When no map can be fetched (no token, no nightly run yet, or the
  pick cannot use it) it runs the whole gate, about an hour on four cores,
  and says why first. -List says what it would run without running it.

  The token comes from GITHUB_TOKEN, GH_TOKEN, or gh auth token, in that
  order, and only reaches Gate-Map.ps1, through GATE_MAP_TOKEN, which that
  script takes out of the environment at once; no harness gets it, nor
  GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN, as on GitHub. tests\test-5183-check-change.ps1
  holds all of this.

  Exits 0 when everything it ran passed, 1 when anything failed, 2 when it
  could not start.
