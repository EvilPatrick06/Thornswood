// makes a throwaway copy of the dev server with the gamemode it is about to
// put on dev (tools/DeployAgent/BotPass.cs), and starts this in that copy as
// a task of its own with no rights outside it. This starts that server,
// plays the parts of the game a bot can reach over the game port and over
// the voice service's relay (a copy of its own, beside the server), stops
// them, and writes what happened. A FAIL in it fails the Deployment and the
// gamemode does not go on dev.

//              git blob it names is this file's), and takes a connection;
//   login      a bot logs in as a profile nobody has, the way the game does,
//              and is sent its character (createActor with isMe);
//   relay      the bot joins the voice service with a join token from its
//              /token, the way the game's chat page does, and sends its join
//              pass over it, which the gamemode takes (relay.js; the pass is
//              signed with a key this copy alone has, in its private folder);
//   new        that character is new: it is sent with the race menu open
//              and with creation already open (the thornswoodChargen
//              property at stage appearance), because gamemode.js opens
//              creation and dresses a new character before the engine hands
//              it over (__thornswoodChargen.created, spawn.ts);
//   face       the bot sends a face (UpdateAppearance) and the gamemode
//              moves the character on to choosing a home, which the bot is
//              told as thornswoodChargen at stage choosing (gamemode.js
//              onUpdateAppearanceAttempt, beginChoosing);
//   home       the bot picks a home town over the relay, as the K panel
//              does, and the gamemode ends creation (thornswoodChargen at
//              stage done) and welcomes it there, a line back over the relay;
//   needs      /needs over the relay is answered with the needs line;
//   saved      the world on disk holds the character with that name;
//   restart    the server is stopped and started again and loads again;
//   loads back a second bot logs in as the same profile and is sent the same
//              character: its name, where it stood, and no race menu.
// The server's own output goes to bot-pass-server.log beside it, and the
// last lines of it into the result, so a FAIL says what the server said. The
// voice service's goes to bot-pass-voice.log in its folder.
//
// The waits are on things the server says or writes, each with a time
// limit: nothing is sent twice, and nothing is put right after the fact.
