  Check-Chargen.ps1

  Preflight for character creation. Everything it looks at is something that
  silently produces a broken first join rather than an error message, so it is
  worth thirty seconds before starting the server.

  It checks, in order:
    - the server's load order holds both plugins the flow needs
    - the plugin carries the ten town passages and the welcome book, each
      named and with a mesh
    - gamemode.js is the build that knows about all of it
    - the start point in server-settings.json is the creation room, computed
      from this load order rather than written down

      .\scripts\ops\Check-Chargen.ps1              the build on this machine
      .\scripts\ops\Check-Chargen.ps1 -From dev    the dev server's own settings
      .\scripts\ops\Check-Chargen.ps1 -From live   the live server's own settings

  ASK THE BOX, NOT ONLY THE BUILD. Until 23 September this read the built
  server on this machine and nothing else, and the file that went wrong was
  the one on the dev box: it keeps its own server-settings.json, which is
  the whole reason Deploy-DevGamemode exists, and its start point was left
  naming file index 58 after the load order under it moved. Skyrim Unbound
  is at 54 there, in a list of 57, so every new character died at login with
  'FromFormId failed due to invalid file index 58' and the client showed a
  box saying only that there were technical difficulties. This check would
  have found it in ten seconds and could not be pointed at the file.

  For a server, every check reads the server's own files (#2950): the plugin
  its load order names and the gamemode.js it runs, on the box, in the same
  call that reads its settings. Only the build reads -Data and -Dist.

  Read only, here and there. It changes nothing on either machine.
