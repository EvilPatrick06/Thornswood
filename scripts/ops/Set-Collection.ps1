  Set-Collection.ps1

      .\scripts\ops\Set-Collection.ps1

  Asks for the collection address and publishes it, in the two places that
  decide it, the same two Set-Server.ps1 uses:

      config.json     this machine's launcher
      version.json    everybody else's, which copies it in on the next check

  Why it matters more than it looks. The installer stopped carrying the mods:
  anything the collection provides is left out of it. So a launcher that does
  not know the collection address is a launcher that installs a game with no
  mods and no way to say where they went, and the error the person sees is the
  server turning them away, which reads as a broken launcher.

  Publishing this is what makes the small installer safe to hand out.

      .\scripts\ops\Set-Collection.ps1 -Clear     put it back to carrying everything
