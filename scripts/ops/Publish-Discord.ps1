  Publish-Discord.ps1

  Posts the newest release into the Discord #news channel.

  Uses the webhook Build-Discord.py made, which is why this needs no bot
  running and no token: a webhook is a one way address into one channel and
  nothing else.

    .\Publish-Discord.ps1
    .\Publish-Discord.ps1 -Quiet
    .\Publish-Discord.ps1 -Dev
    .\Publish-Discord.ps1 -DryRun
    .\Publish-Discord.ps1 -Dev -Note "..." -GamemodeDeploy
    .\Publish-Discord.ps1 -Dev -Record      say the current dev release WAS announced, post nothing

  -DryRun prints what it would post and sends nothing.

  -Note posts the text given, instead of reading the newest release from a
  feed. Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 uses this after a gamemode-only change, which
  has no release for Ship to announce. -GamemodeDeploy goes with -Dev -Note:
  the footer is "dev server", the title is not prefixed, and announced.json
  is not consulted, because every deploy is its own announcement.

  IT REMEMBERS WHAT IT SAID, LINE BY LINE (#3320). Every post, a release or
  a gamemode deploy, goes into announced.json as "posts-main" or "posts-dev"
  (its title and lines, the newest forty), and Ship.ps1 and
  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 refuse a note that says one of them again
  (Note-Repeats.ps1). A gamemode deploy whose record cannot be read still
  posts, as it always did, and says the record was not written.

  IT REMEMBERS WHAT IT POSTED. Until 23 September this script always posted
  whatever was newest in the feed and had no idea it had posted it before, so
  running it twice, or running it days after a release to see what it does,
  announced that release again to everybody. It now writes the version and
  the title it posted into announced.json and refuses to say the same thing
  twice. -Force is how a post that really does need repeating is made, and it
  is the only way.

  WHERE THAT RECORD LIVES (#2167). Until 11 October it was bot\announced.json
  in the checkout that ran this, so a post made from a worktree Ship was
  unknown to every other checkout, and the record went when the worktree did.
  It is now announced.json in the channel's VPS store beside the feed
  (C:\Thornswood-Docs\feed\announced.json and feed-dev\announced.json, not
  served by the site), read and written through Feed-Store.ps1 like the feed
  itself: received into %LOCALAPPDATA%\Thornswood\feed\announced-<channel>,
  and sent back only if nobody else changed it meanwhile. When the store
  cannot be read, nothing is posted (the record cannot say it was not posted
  already); -Force posts anyway. While the store has no record yet, an old
  bot\announced.json in this checkout is still read, never written.
  -Record writes the current release into the store as announced and posts
  nothing: for a post that went out from a checkout whose record was lost.

  Called by Ship.ps1 at the end of every release, so it is usually not run on
  its own. If bot\news-webhook.txt is not there it does nothing and
  says so quietly, so a machine without the Discord set up still ships fine.

  -Dev is the dev build's release, and it is a different channel, a different
  feed and a different webhook. It reads this machine's working copy of the
  dev feed (%LOCALAPPDATA%\Thornswood\feed\dev, Feed-Store.ps1) rather than
  the live one, and it posts through
  bot\dev-webhook.txt, which Set-DevNews.ps1 writes and which points
  at the dev updates channel. Nothing about a dev release reaches #news, the
  website or the main launcher: Ship.ps1 does not run Publish-News.ps1 on a
  dev release, and a dev publish only ever writes the dev feed, which only the
  dev launcher reads.

  Two things this used to get wrong, both visible in the channel:

  A webhook post does not inherit the application's avatar. Without an
  avatar_url every release arrived under the plain blue Discord mark while the
  bot's own messages, right above it in the same channel, carried the
  Thornswood logo.

  And it posted the detail lines raw. The launcher's feed is a developer's
  changelog, so the first bullet under a release title was "Launcher 1.0.197",
  which the embed already says in its footer. Publish-News.ps1 has always
  stripped those on the way to the website. The same list is stripped here.
