  Check-Roster.ps1

  What is in each server's private folder, by name and size only.

  WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A LINE SOMEBODY TYPES. On 21 September this was
  handed over as a raw ssh with nested quotes:

      ssh Administrator@... "powershell -NoProfile -Command \"Get-ChildItem ...\""

  and the far end answered

      \ : The term '\' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet

  because the remote shell re-parses the line and the escaping does not
  survive. That trap is written down on the server build entry of the To Do
  List, with the answer: base64 the script and pass -EncodedCommand, which is
  what Deploy-Server.ps1 has always done. Hand-rolling the quoting a second
  time is how it gets got wrong a second time, so it lives here instead.

  WHAT private HOLDS, and why anybody cares:

    door.json          the door's own config. The door reads it to know where
                       to fetch the roster from. Without it the door never
                       fetches, so /tp refuses everybody including the owner.
    allowed.json       what the site last said about who may play, written by
                       the door. This is the roster.
    characters.json    the character register, written by the gamemode.

  NOTHING IN THEM IS READ OR PRINTED. Names, sizes and last write times only.
  door.json is a config file and its contents are not this script's business.

  Read only. Talks to the VPS.
