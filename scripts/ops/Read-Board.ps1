  Read-Board.ps1

  Reads the whole board, every card's Status and Order, into board.json, from
  a machine that has gh and no board token: a cloud Claude thread (#3192).

      pwsh scripts/ops/Read-Board.ps1
      pwsh scripts/ops/Read-Board.ps1 -OutFile temp/board-review/board.json
      pwsh scripts/ops/Read-Board.ps1 -Run 39712345678

  A cloud thread is refused GraphQL, and the board is read only through
  GraphQL, so this starts .github/workflows/board-read.yml on main, which
  reads the board with the board token on a VPS runner, waits for the run to
  end, reads board.json back out of the run's log and writes it to -OutFile.
  The workflow's header says what the file holds, and why it comes back in
  the log and not as an artifact (#3410: the artifact storage was full).
  Nothing on the board changes.

  -Run reads a run already started, for when the wait ran out before a
  runner took it. GitHub keeps a run's log 90 days.

  Exits:
    0  board.json written; the path and the count per Status are printed
    1  stopped, and the line before says why
    2  the run had not ended in -WaitMinutes; the line to read it later is
       printed
