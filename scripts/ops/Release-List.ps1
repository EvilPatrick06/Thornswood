  Release-List.ps1

  The release list a game server lets go of at its next start (#2351), as
  Reset-Character.ps1, Wipe-Saves.ps1 (#2668) and New-Character.ps1 (#2673)
  write it. Dot-sourced by all three; it does nothing on its own.
  $ThornswoodReleaseList is the text of the functions below, sent with the
  step each script already runs on the server (Windows PowerShell 5.1 there)
  or, for New-Character on a local test server, run in place, so there is
  one copy of it and the scripts cannot drift apart.

  The list is private\deleted-characters.json (the server's privDir), the
  same shape Delete-Person.ps1 writes and game\gamemode.js reads:

      { "profiles": [ ... ], "actors": [ runtime form ids ], "done": { part: time } }

  WHO IT NAMES. A reset, a new character or a wipe throws characters away
  and keeps every profile: the profile keeps its id, its mod menu choices
  and, after a reset or a new character, its house, offices, books and
  farm. So each names the thrown-away characters by form id only and never
  a profile. Each register's release in gamemode.js lets go by profile what
  a profile holds and by form id only what the character held (a dungeon
  chest's reservation, an embassy row with no profile, a trader's supply
  waits, commission promises and a trade waiting on that character, and
  the trade ships' manifest, #511), so a list with no profiles in it never
  takes anything a profile holds (#2668 has the table, part by part).

  A character's form id is read off its change form the way Delete-Person
  reads it: profileId above 0 and a formDesc made in the world, a hex
  number with no plugin (FormDesc::ToString), which is the form's local id.
  The list keeps the runtime form id, 0xff000000 + that local id, the one
  shape every register keeps (#2870, ConvertFrom-ThornswoodFormDesc, the
  twin of game\form-id.js). A change form that will not parse, or a
  character's whose formDesc is not a runtime form, is named in a
  RELEASENOTE line, so nobody is left off the list without it being said.
  A list there whose actors are local ids, the shape from before #2870, is
  not one: scripts\ops\Convert-FormIdShape.js converts it.

  WHERE IT GOES. The privDir server-settings.json names, as the server reads
  it; private when the file names none or is not there. A server-settings.json
  that is there and will not parse is a server that will not start, and a
  list put in a guessed folder would never be read, so nothing is written
  and the caller is told (RELEASEBAD).

  MERGED, NOT REPLACED. A list still waiting there (a deletion the server
  has not let go of yet) keeps every id it names; the new ids join it. A
  list there that is not one is never overwritten: the caller is told and
  writes nothing. Done is what the caller says: cleared for a reset, so
  every part runs for the new ids; for a wipe, the parts whose registers
  the wipe has just set aside, so only the merchant ledger, the register a
  wipe keeps, waits on it.

  AND 'saves' WHEN NO PROFILE IS NAMED. The part 'saves' is server-log.js's
  (scripts\vps\Server-Log.js, #2758): it takes the change forms, card, mod
  menu choices, take counts and last-left time of the profiles a list names,
  and nothing else. A list that names no profile leaves it nothing to do,
  and a server on this machine (Reset-Character -UseLocal, New-Character)
  is started as node dist_back/skymp5-server.js by the launcher or by hand,
  never under
  server-log.js, so nothing there would ever mark it done and the list
  would wait for good. So the merged list marks 'saves' done itself when it
  names no profile. A list carrying a profile still waiting (a deletion not
  yet let go of) leaves 'saves' to server-log.js.

  Each function says what it did as lines, for the caller to print:
    RELEASE|<file>|<profiles>|<characters>[|done: <parts>]
    RELEASE|none                     nothing to name
    RELEASENOTE|<why>                carried on, but worth saying
    RELEASEBAD|<why>                 no list was written
