  Set-DevNews.ps1

  Points dev releases at the Discord channel for dev build updates, so they
  stop being something only the dev launcher ever mentions and stay out of
  #news, where everybody reads about the build they actually play.

      .\scripts\ops\Set-DevNews.ps1

  It asks for a webhook URL and nothing else. Make one first:

    Discord, the dev updates channel, Edit Channel, Integrations, Webhooks,
    New Webhook, then Copy Webhook URL.

  The URL is a credential: anyone holding it can post in that channel as the
  bot. It is pasted at a prompt rather than taken on the command line, it is
  never printed back, and it is stored on the VPS (Discord-Hook.ps1), never in
  git, so every machine that ships reads it from there. Only
  Publish-Discord.ps1 reads it, on a dev release.

  Before it saves anything it asks Discord what that webhook points at. A
  webhook URL carries its own authority, so this needs no bot token. If it
  points at a channel other than the one in bot\dev-channel.txt,
  it says so and saves nothing: posting dev notes into #news by accident is
  the one thing this is here to prevent.

      .\scripts\ops\Set-DevNews.ps1 -Check     says what is set up now, changes
                                         nothing, prints no secret
      .\scripts\ops\Set-DevNews.ps1 -Clear     forgets the webhook. Dev releases go
                                         back to telling nobody.
