  Check-Board.ps1

  Holds the board's cards to the rules Developer-Guide.md gives them, from a
  board.json Read-Board.ps1 wrote, and names every card that breaks one. Run
  by the weekly reviews from a cloud thread (#3534):

      pwsh scripts/ops/Read-Board.ps1 -OutFile temp/review/board.json
      pwsh scripts/ops/Check-Board.ps1 -Board temp/review/board.json

  It changes nothing, on the board or anywhere else.

  WHY (#3534). The 25 Oct 2026 weekly review listed the board's Order under
  "Could not read". Read-Board.ps1 has read every card's Order since #3192,
  but its read failed that day on the full artifact storage (#3410), and
  nothing then said what a right Order is. Read again at 11:41 AM on 26 Oct
  (run 40370916888): 315 of the 331 open issues had no Order at all.

  WHAT IT HOLDS EACH CARD TO (Developer-Guide.md, "Everything we need to do
  goes on the board"):
    no order      an open issue with no Order. "Order is the do-order. A new
                  issue gets the Order of where it belongs."
    shared order  two open cards with the same Order, so neither is first.
    no status     an open card with no Status. The options are Todo, In
                  Progress and Done.
    closed open   a closed issue whose Status is not Done. The board's own
                  "Item closed" workflow sets Done; a closed card elsewhere
                  is one it missed.
    statuses      the Status options are Todo, In Progress and Done, in that
                  order ("never add one through the API").
    workflows     Auto-add to project on, so every issue gets a card;
                  Auto-close issue off, since a Done issue still waits on its
                  test (#3076).
    no card       an open issue of the repository, made before the board was
                  read, with no card, when the open issues are read too
                  (-Issues, or gh; -NoIssues skips).
  An archived card is left out of every check but "no card".

  Exits:
    0  every card keeps every rule; what was checked is printed
    1  stopped, and the line before says why
    3  it names cards or settings that break a rule, one line each, under a
       heading per rule with its count
