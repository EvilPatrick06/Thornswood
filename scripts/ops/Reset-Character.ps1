  Reset-Character.ps1

  Throws away the character on the server so the next launch runs creation from
  the top. Works against the VPS or against a server on this machine.

  Your character is not a save file under SkyMP. It is a change form the server
  holds, so New Game in Skyrim's own menu hands the same body, the same
  inventory and the same face straight back. This is the only thing that
  actually gives you a new one.

  The change forms named with a bare number are the ones belonging to people.
  Everything else in that folder describes the world and is left alone. Nothing
  is deleted: what is thrown away goes into a _discarded folder beside it.

      .\Reset-Character.ps1            the VPS
      .\Reset-Character.ps1 -Local     a server running on this machine

  The launcher has no switch for this (its unused copy went in #2673); for a
  server on this machine use -UseLocal here, or New-Character.ps1, which
  writes the same release list. Neither holds your VPS password.

  WHAT THE SERVER STILL HOLDS OF THE CHARACTER IS LET GO AT ITS NEXT START
  (#2668). A guild trader keys its supply waits and a trade still waiting by
  the character's form id (#2652), and that form id can be handed to the
  next character made. So the characters thrown away are written into the
  release list, private\deleted-characters.json (Release-List.ps1, the same
  list Delete-Person.ps1 writes, #2351), by form id only: the profile keeps
  its id and everything it holds (a house, an office, a book, a farm, the mod
  menu choices), so no profile is ever named. The start right after this
  lets go of the rest and the list is gone. A list already there that is not
  one stops this before anything is moved.

  THE SERVER IS STOPPED AND WAITED FOR, NOT SLEPT ON (#2871). Until 22 Oct
  2026 both paths ended the server and slept two seconds before moving its
  files, and the VPS path then slept three more and knocked on <box>:3000
  from here up to twenty times, with an empty catch: always the live port,
  whatever -TaskName and -VpsRoot named. A process asked to stop still holds
  its files until it has exited (measured on the box, #2928), and a start
  takes as long as it takes (#1938). So each server process is opened before
  it is ended and waited for until it has exited (StopAndMove.ps1, as the
  installer and every swap do), and nothing is moved while one is still
  there. On the VPS the server on -VpsRoot's own port is the one stopped, the
  box waits for both of its ports to answer from 127.0.0.1 within the shared
  ceiling (ServerReadyWait.ps1), and this machine then tries that resources
  port once from outside (Test-ThornswoodFromOutside, Vps.ps1).
