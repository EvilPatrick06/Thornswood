  Reset-Npcs.ps1

      .\scripts\ops\Reset-Npcs.ps1 -Server dev -Survey     says what it would take
      .\scripts\ops\Reset-Npcs.ps1 -Server dev             takes it, after RESET is typed

  Starts every NPC on one game server again from its plugin record, and
  leaves every character and every private register as it is (#4595).
  NpcReset.ps1 says which saved change forms count as NPCs, what it measures
  as it goes and where they are put; this is the part that runs it on the box.

  WHY. The engine fork's #98 gives an NPC only the gear it fights and looks
  with, marked as its own, from the moment its inventory is first made. NPCs
  saved before that engine reached a server keep the inventory they were
  saved with, vanilla coin and pockets included, through every death and
  respawn. Moving their change forms aside is what lets the engine make them
  again. Wipe-Saves.ps1 is not this: it starts every character over and sets
  aside every register beside them.

  RUN IT ONLY ON A SERVER THAT ALREADY RUNS #98. An NPC made again by an
  engine before it is unmarked again. -Survey says how many NPCs carry the
  mark (NPCMARKS) before and after.

  -Server dev or -Server main, required: the folder is the one each deploy
  uses (C:\Thornswood-Server-Dev, task 'Thornswood Dev Server', and
  C:\Thornswood-Server, task 'Thornswood Server', as Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1
  and Deploy-Server.ps1 name them), and its server-settings.json must say
  thornswoodServer is that name, or nothing is touched.

  -Survey reads the change forms where they are, with the server running,
  and moves nothing. Without it the server on that folder's own game port is
  opened, stopped and waited for until it has exited (StopAndMove.ps1, as
  Reset-Character.ps1 does), the NPCs are moved aside, and the task is
  started again if the server was running, and waited for on both ports
  (ServerReadyWait.ps1). If the server is found running again after the move
  and before this started it, something else started it while the files
  moved (the watchdog, #5155): that is said and the run fails, because the
  NPCs it loaded will be saved back.

  It asks for RESET to be typed before it takes anything. -Yes answers that,
  for the deploy gate, which runs it as Reset-Npcs-Dev and Reset-Npcs-Main
  (scripts\vps\gate\verbs.json) with -Yes and -NoPause and only -Survey to
  add:

    pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Reset-Npcs-Dev -Survey'
    pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Reset-Npcs-Dev'

  Main is a live verb: its line names main's full commit with -Build.

  Stop before you run it without -Survey if people are on. It puts them out.
