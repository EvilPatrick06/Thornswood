  Set-Server.ps1

  Sets the server everyone connects to, in the two places that decide it, and
  sends the feed to the VPS (#907).

      .\Set-Server.ps1 -Address <from scripts\vps\vps.json> -Port 7777

  The two places:
    config.json     this machine's launcher
    version.json    every other launcher, which copies it into their config on
                    the next update check

  Only changing one of them does not hold. Fix config.json alone and the next
  update check puts the published value straight back over it. Fix version.json
  alone and the next publish copies this machine's stale config over that. They
  have to move together, which is what this does.

  It checks the address answers before writing anything, because publishing one
  that does not is how five people end up in single player wondering what they
  broke. -Force skips that.
