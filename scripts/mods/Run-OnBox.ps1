  Run-OnBox.ps1

  Runs one of the repository's content tools on the VPS box, against the game
  plugins a game server there already holds, and brings back what the tool
  wrote into the repository's game\, records\ and docs\systems\ folders.
  Issue #2899.

      pwsh scripts/mods/Run-OnBox.ps1 scripts/mods/Add-ContentRecords.py --check --masters '{data}'
      pwsh scripts/mods/Run-OnBox.ps1 scripts/mods/Add-ContentRecords.py --masters '{data}'
      pwsh scripts/mods/Run-OnBox.ps1 scripts/mods/Build-LastPlugin.py --data '{data}'
      pwsh scripts/mods/Run-OnBox.ps1 scripts/mods/Rebuild-ContentTables.ps1 -Data '{data}' -PluginsTxt '{plugins}'

  A tool is a .py (run by the box's Python), a .js (its node) or a .ps1 (its
  PowerShell 7) under scripts\mods or scripts\dev. Until #3100 only a
  Python tool could run here, and the threads did not know the box held
  Skyrim's archives, so #2906's records and #3077's plugin ran on One on
  21 Oct 2026 though the box held what they read. The last line above runs
  the whole chain of scripts\mods\content-tables.json; its tables are not
  yet the ones a game PC writes (#3105), so Developer-Guide.md still sends
  the whole rebuild to a PC with the game.

  WHY. Patrick, 20 Oct 2026: "let's make the content plugin available in the
  cloud". The content plugin's tools read the game's Data folder, which was
  only on One (C:\Thornswood\Game\Data). Measured 20 Oct from a cloud
  session: both game servers on the box hold every plugin of the load order
  in their plugins folder (103 files, 383 MB), because a server loads them,
  and the box has Python 3.12. So the tool goes to the plugins, and no
  Bethesda or mod author's file is copied anywhere it was not already.
  Skyrim's own archives (.bsa) and the loose string tables a localized
  master needs are in C:\Thornswood-GameData on the box (Patrick's A on
  #2899; Send-GameArchives.ps1 puts them there), and every run links them
  into its data folder, so the tools that read names, meshes or the
  interface read them there too.

  WHAT GOES UP. The commit, never the working tree: the tools, the plugins
  and the tables they read (scripts\mods, scripts\dev, game\content,
  game\data, records, layout.json, and every other file a Python builder of
  scripts\mods\content-tables.json reads or writes, game\gamemode.js among
  them) as one artifact (Artifact.ps1, #459), so
  an uncommitted change under those folders refuses the run before the box
  is asked anything. Commit it first; what ran is then a commit anyone can
  name.

  ON THE BOX, one folder of the run's own under C:\Windows\Temp. It lives
  as long as one ssh session, the keeper's (scripts\mods\OnBox.ps1, #2999):
  the keeper makes it, holds it for the whole run and removes it when this
  says the run is over or the session drops. A keeper killed with its session
  cannot remove anything, but it stops holding the folder when it dies, and
  the next run's keeper removes every folder nobody holds before it makes its
  own. So nothing stays on the box past the next run, however a run ended:
    repo\         the artifact, laid out like the repository; the tool runs here
    data\         a copy of the server's plugins folder, with this commit's own
                  Thornswood plugins in place of the ones the server runs. A
                  copy, not links, so a tool given --data {data} that writes
                  can never reach the server's own files
    plugins.txt   the server's load order as the game's plugin list: a '*'
                  line for each plugin of its server-settings.json loadOrder
                  after Skyrim's five masters, which the game loads first and
                  never lists (own_plugins.py). The builders that take a
                  plugin list read the load order the server runs, not
                  whichever profile a PC last had
  '{data}' in an argument is the data folder, '{plugins}' the plugin list and
  '{repo}' the repository folder, all on the box. THORNSWOOD_DATA names the
  data folder too, for the tools that read it. The tool runs at below normal
  priority, because the box is also where both game servers run.

  WHAT COMES BACK. Every file under game\, records\ and docs\systems\ that
  the tool wrote or changed, by sha256 against what was sent, and nothing
  else (Rebuild-ContentTables.ps1 writes the cut item list into
  docs\systems). It is put into this checkout at the same path, and listed,
  so git diff shows what the run did. A tool that changed nothing brings
  nothing back.

  The tools themselves are unchanged: run on One, they read
  C:\Thornswood\Game\Data as before.
