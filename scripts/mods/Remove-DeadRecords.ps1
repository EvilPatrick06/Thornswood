  Remove-DeadRecords.ps1

  Deletes records from Thornswood-Content.esp that nothing uses any more, and
  refuses to delete one that anything still points at.

  WHY

  Patrick, 21 September: "the books were supposed to be replaced with our new
  system", and then "let's clean up the historical stuff so it's not all a mess
  when we try to change and implement things and people don't download more
  than what they even need".

  WHAT GOES, AND WHY EACH ONE IS DEAD

    ThornswoodWrit*   sixteen books, one per trade of the OLD sixteen trade
                      system: warrior, hunter, mage, smith, miner, woodworker,
                      alchemist, bard, cook, enchanter, farmer, fisher,
                      merchant, priest, scholar and thief. The five classes and
                      eight professions replaced all sixteen, so a Writ of the
                      Bard is a book about a trade this server does not have.
                      Nothing live reads one: the only references are in
                      tools\thornswood-src, which is a historical pipeline, and
                      in its own tests.

  WHAT DOES NOT GO, AND THIS MATTERS

    ThornswoodPassage*  NINE of these key CHARGEN.towns in gamemode.js. The
                        creation panel's town list is literally keyed by their
                        form ids, so deleting them breaks choosing a home. They
                        stay. The tenth, Ravenrock, is unused, and it stays too
                        rather than being deleted for the sake of one record.
    Thornswood*Novice/Advanced/Expert/Master  the seventeen rank manuals still
                        do something: reading one counts once as work in the
                        ladder it is about. They are placed nowhere, which is a
                        separate entry on the list, not a reason to delete them.

  WHAT IT PROVES BEFORE IT WRITES

  Same discipline as the editor id rename of 21 September, whose parser this
  borrowed (that script did its one job and is gone, #400). It reads the file and writes it back byte for byte first, because a
  parser that cannot reproduce what it was given has no business editing it.
  Then, for every record it is about to delete, it searches every other record
  in the file for that form id, INCLUDING the hundred compressed ones, which it
  inflates. A compressed record is where a placed reference lives, so leaving
  them unsearched would be leaving out the only place the answer could be. If
  anything at all points at a candidate, nothing is written.

  Afterwards it checks the result: every record that was not deleted is still
  there, in the same order, with the same form id, type, flags and bytes.

  THIS IS A SHIPPED FILE, so its size changing means a release and every client
  downloading it again.

  Usage:
    .\scripts\mods\Remove-DeadRecords.ps1 -Check
    .\scripts\mods\Remove-DeadRecords.ps1

  Exit code 1 if anything points at a candidate, if the parse does not round
  trip, or if the result does not verify.

<#
  THE HEADER'S RECORD COUNT, which this used to leave alone and should not have.

  HEDR carries the number of records in the file after a version float. Deleting
  sixteen records without changing it leaves the file saying it holds sixteen
  more than it does. Measured 21 September: the header had said 408 since before
  this script existed while the file held 392, so the rename before it and this
  script after it had both walked past a number that was already wrong, and the
  trim made it worse. The engine plainly does not read it, because the plugin has
  been shipping and working in that state, but a wrong number in a file is a
  thing somebody trusts later.

  So it is written from what is actually there, every time, rather than adjusted
  by however many went. Adjusting a wrong number keeps it wrong.
