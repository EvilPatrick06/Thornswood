  Set-UnboundMenu.ps1

  RETIRED. DO NOT RUN. Issue #1179: swapped Skyrim Unbound's MCM script by hand. The collection (or the settled load order) does this now. It refuses to run, and the rest of the file is kept for the history of how it was installed. Pattern from #405 Add-Bodies.

  What it used to do, and what is left of it:

  Switches Skyrim Unbound's config menu between the locked version and the
  full one.

  The shipped build runs a patched SkyrimUnboundMCMScript.pex whose page list
  is a single entry, Starting Location. That is what stops people handing
  themselves gear during character creation. It also stops YOU setting a class
  up, because Equipment, Spells and Inventory are the pages you need to build
  a preset.

  So: unlock, build the preset in game, save it under Unbound's own preset
  menu, quit, lock again, ship. The preset survives, since it is a file in
  SKSE\Plugins\SkyrimUnbound\Presets, and the menu goes back to one page for
  everyone else.

      .\scripts\mods\Set-UnboundMenu.ps1 -Full      every page, for authoring presets
      .\scripts\mods\Set-UnboundMenu.ps1 -Locked    Starting Location only, for shipping
