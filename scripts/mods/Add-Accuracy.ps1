  Add-Accuracy.ps1

  RETIRED. DO NOT RUN. Issue #1179: hand-installed Core Impact Framework and Accuracy, then Ships. The collection (or the settled load order) does this now. It refuses to run, and the rest of the file is kept for the history of how it was installed. Pattern from #405 Add-Bodies.

  What it used to do, and what is left of it:

  Localised combat damage. Where you hit somebody starts to matter, on top
  of what Precision already does for where your weapon actually is.

  Both of these are SKSE plugins with no plugin of their own, so the load
  order does not move and nobody has to start a new character.

  The one thing that matters in co-op: this is entirely client side, and
  damage is worked out on the machine of whoever swung. If one
  person has different numbers to everyone else, health bars disagree across
  screens and kills land at different times. So the config files ship with
  the build rather than being left to each person's MCM, and the optional
  MCM menu is deliberately not installed.
