  Add-McmShortcut.ps1

  RETIRED. DO NOT RUN. Issue #1179: hand-installed MCM Shortcut NG, then Ships. The collection (or the settled load order) does this now. It refuses to run, and the rest of the file is kept for the history of how it was installed. Pattern from #405 Add-Bodies.

  What it used to do, and what is left of it:

  Installs MCM Shortcut NG, which is what lets Skyrim Unbound open its own
  config menu.

  Unbound does not open the MCM itself. It calls
  MCMShortcutNG.OpenMCM(modName, delay, pageName, delay), and before that it
  asks MCMShortcutNG.IsInstalled(). With the plugin missing that answer is
  always no, so the menu never appears and the starting location can only be
  reached by opening the journal by hand.

  Unbound opens Pages[0], and Pages[0] is now the Starting Location page, so
  once this is in, character creation runs itself: face, then location, then
  class.

      .\scripts\mods\Add-McmShortcut.ps1

  Options:
      -Notes "..."     what the News page says about this release
      -NoShip          install only, publish nothing

  Download both files from the mod page, the main plugin and the optional
  "Default INI and JSON", and leave them in Downloads.
