Build-LastPlugin.py

Builds Thornswood-Last.esp, the small plugin that loads at the very end of the
load order, from the installed plugins and the repository's own tables. Every
byte of it comes out of this script. Nobody edits it in an editor.

WHY (issue #2468)

Patrick, 12 October: "make it so the server and client never load the cut NPCs
not even once ... currently it shows them for a split second the first time you
go in that area and then they disappear", and the dialogue pop-ups "when you go
through the White run gate ... I don't want that there like at all". The same
day: "all vanilla quests can also be cut entirely and never loaded". He
approved a small plugin at the end of the load order on 12 October, for #516
and #1394 as well as this.

WHY THE CUT ONES FLASHED, measured in the fork at its pin (ea523711):

  The server never made them. game/gamemode.js hands the catalogue's cut list
  to setNpcPlacementExclusions, and WorldState::LoadForm refuses every one of
  those ids before it reads the record.

  Each person's own game did. Skyrim loads every placed actor of a cell from the
  plugins the moment the cell loads. The client's WorldCleanerService
  (skymp5-client/src/services/services/worldCleanerService.ts) then removes
  actors the server does not own, ONE PER FRAME, picked at random among the
  actors within 8,192 units, with disable() and delete(). With a few dozen
  placed actors in a city that is seconds of them standing there. That is the
  flash. The cleaner skips an actor that is disabled already.

  The gate talk came from vanilla quests that run in each person's own game:
  Skyrim starts every quest flagged Start Game Enabled when the game loads, and
  the Story Manager starts the others on its events (arriving at a location,
  actors near each other). SkyMP blocks Papyrus events on the client
  (blockPapyrusEventsService.ts), but dialogue, packages, force greets and
  scenes are the engine's own and run without Papyrus. The Whiterun gate's
  quest, DialogueWhiterunGuardGateStop (d1984:Skyrim.esm), is Start Game
  Enabled; its guard's WhiterunGateGuardForcegreet package (d198b) is the
  pop-up.

WHAT IT PUTS IN THE PLUGIN

  1. Every placed actor the NPC catalogue cuts (game/data/npc-population.json,
     the 1 October rules) is overridden INITIALLY DISABLED, with no enable
     parent, so no machine ever draws it and the server's reader
     (WorldState::AttachEspmRecord) never makes it. The override keeps the
     actor's base, position and editor id and nothing else: no scripts, no
     links, no enable parent, so nothing can switch it back on.
     Left alone: actors a later plugin already deleted, actors that are
     already disabled with no enable parent (they never show), and the
     authored corpses while the policy file says they stay (decision on #2468).

  2. Every vanilla quest (Skyrim.esm, Update.esm, Dawnguard.esm,
     HearthFires.esm, Dragonborn.esm), except the ones the policy file keeps
     (Patrick's decisions on #2468), is overridden so it can never start in anybody's
     game: Start Game Enabled is cleared, and a condition that is never true
     is put first among its Story Manager conditions, as an AND, so no Story
     Manager event can start it. Everything else on the quest is the winning
     record's own. The gate, door and arrival talk is in these quests.

  3. The mod quests the policy names (modQuestsStopped) are stopped the same
     way: the collection's mods' own gate, door and arrival talk (Patrick,
     12 October, decision 8 on #2468). A quest with such talk that the policy
     neither stops nor keeps stops the build, so a new one is decided, not
     missed.

  4. The places on Tamriel's ground that Skyrim and the collection's mods put
     in no hold get one (Patrick, 17 October 2026, decision 2 = B on #2551),
     from the policy's placeHolds. A location record is copied from its
     winner with only its parent (PNAM) changed: to the hold's location, or
     to the place on Patrick's list it lies in (Dead Drop Falls, in
     Dayspring Canyon), so the game, the server, the main menu's last
     location and scripts/dev/Build-BuildingHolds.py all read the place in
     that hold. A room that has no location record at all (Oar's Rest's
     utility room, the Lost Hut, Mossy Glen Cave) cannot have a parent
     changed, so its cell is copied from its winner with only its location
     (XLCN) set: the location of the place it belongs to when there is one,
     the hold's own when none covers it. Everything else on each record is
     the winner's own.

  5. Nothing lies on the floor (Patrick, 21 October 2026, #3077: "don't
     spawn floor items anymore at all no matter what they are"). Every
     placed reference whose base a person could pick up is overridden
     initially disabled, keeping its base and position, the way a cut actor
     is: every weapon, armour piece, arrow, misc item, potion, ingredient,
     book, soul gem, scroll, key and note, every light that can be carried
     (a torch; every other light is the world's lighting), and the six coin
     purses, which are flora. Every other flora (plants, fish, hanging game)
     is a harvestable and stays. A thing a person drops is made at runtime,
     in no plugin, and is never touched. One already initially disabled is
     left only when nothing could switch it on: no enable parent and no
     script. A Thornswood plugin's own floor
     item, and a reference whose enable parent is a floor item, stop the
     build, so each is decided rather than switched off unasked. What the
     servers saved about a floor item before needs no clearing: the server
     attaches a plugin reference's saved state only to a reference its
     reader made (WorldState::LoadChangeForm holds it back,
     WorldState::LoadForm applies it), and the reader never makes an
     initially disabled one. A floor item placed by a plugin the policy
     never copies from (notCopiedFrom: Immersive Armors, #2454) has no
     record below it to switch off, and its own is not copied (Patrick,
     22 Oct 2026, q-613-ia-recipes); one standing in a cell or world such a
     plugin wins would need that plugin's record of the place copied, or
     its edit of it undone. Each of those is listed in the manifest
     (floorItems.heldByServer) and in the HELD_BY_SERVER block this
     writes into game/gamemode.js, and the server holds it disabled
     itself, the way it holds the three chopping blocks (#495). A cut actor
     (1) standing in such a place is held off the same way
     (refs.heldByServer).

  6. The forge recipes game/data/recost.json re-costs (Patrick, 21 October
     2026, A on #613, and B on #3115): each is the winning record with only
     its input counts changed to the ones the table gives, and an input the
     table takes to 0 (gold coins) taken out, so the same output, bench and
     conditions. scripts/dev/Build-Recost.py writes the table from
     game/data/recipes.json; a winning record whose inputs are not the ones
     the table measured stops the build, because the counts were worked out
     for those inputs and no others. A recipe of a plugin the policy never
     copies from (notCopiedFrom) is not in the table's recipes but its
     notCopied, and one that reached the recipes stops the build like any
     other record of such a plugin (6).

  7. The script properties the policy sets on a mod quest
     (questScriptProperties), each the winning record with only those values
     added or changed on the script the policy names. Skyrim Unbound's start
     (SkyrimUnboundQuestScript.PrepareForStart, then the inventory module's
     GivePlayerStuff) runs in each person's own game and hands the new
     character a random weapon, equipped, which the server never gave: it
     hangs on the hip, invisible, in no inventory, and can still be drawn and
     swung (#3101; Djinn read the compiled scripts on 16 Oct 2026, #2039).
     SkyrimUnboundInventory's ChoiceRandomWeapons False gives no weapon, and
     its ChoiceSpellsMode 1 gives no spell, which would leave the same kind of
     thing in a hand. Patrick, 21 Oct 2026, on the board review (#3192): the
     fix is here. Skyrim Unbound.esp loads after Thornswood-Content.esp, so
     its own record would win over a change there. A property the script
     does not carry is added, one it carries is changed, one of another type
     stops the build, and so does a script the quest does not have.

  8. The hold-only plants and ores (Patrick, 22 Oct 2026, page answer A on
     #3150: each hold has 2 to 3 hold-only plants, ores or animals, which
     grow only in their own hold). The policy's holdOnly names each by its
     produce and its hold; every base of game/data/harvests.json or
     game/data/ores.json that gives that produce is hold-only. Every placed
     reference of one standing anywhere but its hold is overridden initially
     disabled, keeping its base and position, the way a floor item is (5),
     and the ones in their hold stay. The hold is the NPC catalogue's rule
     (scripts/dev/Build-CastTable.py, Cast.place): the location the
     reference carries, then its cell's, then the ground under a world's
     persistent cell, then the nearest ground within six cells that names a
     place, with the policy's place holds (4) read in. A Thornswood
     plugin's own placement outside its hold, and one a quest or trade
     table draws from (SOURCE_TABLES), stop the build. Which ones was
     measured by scripts/dev/Measure-HoldResources.py, and the policy says
     what it found beside each.

  A placed actor's or item's override needs the cell it stands in, and the worldspace
  for an exterior, so those are copied too, EXACTLY as the winning plugin has
  them, form ids moved into this plugin's numbering. A quest and a location
  are copied the same way. The plugin's own masters are every plugin those
  copies name.

WHY NOT IN Thornswood-Content.esp

  A copied cell has to be the record that wins at the copy's place in the load
  order, or it undoes the cell edits of the plugins before it. Measured
  12 October: the 1,212 cells holding the actors this switches off have 47
  different winning plugins. 163 of those cells are won by a mod that loads
  before Thornswood-Content.esp, whose edits a copy there could not carry with
  its five base masters, and 429 by one of the 50 plugins that load after it.
  At the end of the load order every copy is the winner, exactly. So
  everything is here.

  The place holds (4) are here for the same reasons, measured 17 October
  over the catalogue's load order: Castle Volkihar's location is won by
  JK's Castle Volkihar.esp, which loads before the content plugin and is not
  among its five masters, so a copy there would undo that mod's edit of it;
  Oar's Rest's utility room and the Lost Hut are OarsRest.esp's and Solitude
  Arena.esp's, which load after the content plugin and so cannot be its
  masters at all; and a new master renumbers every record the content plugin
  adds. Here the copy is the winner, and any plugin can be a master.

WHY IT IS LIGHT (ESL FLAGGED)

  It adds no record of its own, only overrides, so it takes no full load order
  slot: every full plugin keeps its index, and no world reset follows from
  adding it. The server's load order already carries light plugins (#1715).

WHAT IT READS

  The load order is the NPC catalogue's own (npc-population.json loadOrder),
  read from --data, and every plugin has to be the bytes the catalogue was
  built from (sha256), except Thornswood's own (every file in game/content,
  scripts/dev/own_plugins.py), which are read from the repository's
  game/content, where they are made and shipped from. A load order that moved
  means the catalogue is rebuilt first (scripts/dev/Build-NpcPopulation.py), then this. This
  plugin is never read as an input: it is what the catalogue and the policy
  produce, and the catalogue reads past it too.

  game/data/last-plugin-policy.json is what is kept: the quests a kept
  Thornswood feature may still need, until Patrick decides each one, and
  whether the authored corpses stay. Localised names (a cell's, a quest's) are
  read out of the masters' string tables and written in plain, because this
  plugin is not localised.

WHAT IT WRITES

  game/content/Thornswood-Last.esp, and game/data/last-plugin.json, the
  manifest: the plugin's sha256, the load order it was built against, every
  cut actor it switches off and every one it leaves and why, every quest it
  stops and every quest it keeps, and every place it gives a hold, with the
  parent or location it had before, and the floor items it switches off,
  counted by type and by the plugin that won each, with the cells only they
  needed (#2791 reads those). tests/test-2468-last-plugin.js holds the two
  together on every build, without the game, tests/test-2551-place-holds.js
  the place holds and tests/test-3077-floor-items.js the floor items.

HOW IT REACHES PEOPLE

  From this repository, exactly the way Thornswood-Content.esp goes (Patrick,
  12 October, #2486 B), never through the collection:

    servers  Deploy-DevGamemode.ps1 -LoadOrder (and the full Deploy-Server.ps1
             for live) sends game/content/Thornswood-Last.esp and puts it at
             the end of the server's load order.
    people   every Ship places it in the release's Data (Ensure-ShipRequiredData
             in Ship-Rules.ps1), the pack carries it, and the pack's plugin
             list enables it last, in the server's order.
    order    the server has it first, then the Ship (#2308): a release that
             changes it is refused until the channel's server holds the same
             bytes.
    bytes    a release is refused when the plugin was built against other
             bytes than the release's own plugins, or another load order
             (Get-ShipLastPluginProblem): a new collection revision means
             running this again, never shipping a plugin that would undo it.

  The catalogue lists it in the servers' load order and the gamemode no longer
  hands the server a cut list of its own; tests/test-2468-last-plugin.js holds
  that coupling both ways.

Usage:
    python scripts/mods/Build-LastPlugin.py --check
    python scripts/mods/Build-LastPlugin.py
    python scripts/mods/Build-LastPlugin.py --verify
    python scripts/mods/Build-LastPlugin.py --data C:\\Thornswood\\Game\\Data

--check builds it in memory and says whether the committed plugin and manifest
are those bytes. --verify reads the load order with the committed plugin at
its end and checks, record by record, that no cut actor and no floor item is
left able to show and no cut quest is left able to start, and lists the gate, door and arrival
talk with what stops each. Exit 1 on any refusal.
