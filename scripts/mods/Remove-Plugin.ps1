  Remove-Plugin.ps1

  RETIRED. DO NOT RUN. Issue #1179: took one plugin out of the build by hand. The collection (or the settled load order) does this now. It refuses to run, and the rest of the file is kept for the history of how it was installed. Pattern from #405 Add-Bodies.

  What it used to do, and what is left of it:

      .\scripts\mods\Remove-Plugin.ps1

  Takes one plugin out of the Thornswood build, reversibly.

  It moves the plugin and any archive named after it into Game\_removed with
  today's date on it, and takes the line out of plugins.txt so the next
  Deploy-Gamemode builds a load order without it. Nothing is deleted.

  Read this before using it. SkyMP turns a form id into a plugin with plain
  arithmetic on the plugin's POSITION in the load order. Take one out of the
  middle and every plugin below it moves up a slot, so a stored reference made
  under the old numbering now points at a different plugin. That is why this
  prints the slot it is removing and how many move, and why the honest way to
  follow it is Wipe-Saves.ps1 rather than hoping.

  Doing this to the last plugin in the list moves nothing and is free. Doing it
  to slot 6 of 61 moves 55.
