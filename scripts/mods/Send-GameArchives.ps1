  Send-GameArchives.ps1

  Puts Skyrim's own archives that the content tools read on the VPS box, in
  C:\Thornswood-GameData, each checked against records\skyrim-files.json on
  this machine before it goes and on the box after it lands, and the loose
  string tables records\game-strings.json names, held to that record the
  same way. Issue #2899.

      .\scripts\mods\Send-GameArchives.ps1
      .\scripts\mods\Send-GameArchives.ps1 -Data 'D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data'
      .\scripts\mods\Send-GameArchives.ps1 -Check

  WHY. Patrick, 20 Oct 2026, A on #2899 (his page answer): "All needed
  archives. Interface, Meshes0-1 and Textures0-8 (about 9.7 GB) go in a
  staff-only folder on the box." scripts\mods\Run-OnBox.ps1 runs the content
  tools on the box against a game server's plugins; the string tables, the
  start menu, the meshes and the textures those tools also read were only on
  One. With them on the box, every content tool runs from a machine with no
  game at all.

  WHAT GOES. The twelve archives scripts\mods\OnBox.ps1 names, each held to
  the size and sha1 records\skyrim-files.json gives for the pinned Skyrim
  build, so a changed or modded archive is refused here, before anything is
  sent. Then the loose string tables records\game-strings.json names, each
  held to its size and sha256 there, into Strings. Measured 20 Oct: the
  first run from the cloud stopped Build-LastPlugin at "no strings for
  RaceCompatibility.esm", a localized master among the last plugin's whose
  tables are loose in Data\Strings and in no archive. No plugin goes, and no
  other file of a mod's. A file the box already holds with those bytes is
  not sent again.

  ON THE BOX. C:\Thornswood-GameData is made locked (SYSTEM's and
  Administrators' only, Lock-Folder.ps1 -Only) and nothing serves it. Each
  file arrives as .incoming-<name> at the top of the folder, is hashed there,
  and takes its place only when it is the recorded bytes; then it is made
  read only to everyone but SYSTEM (OnBox.ps1 says why). An arrival that is
  not the recorded bytes is deleted and the run stops. Arriving at the top
  keeps a half-sent string table out of Strings, which every run links.

  -Check hashes what is here and asks the box what it holds, and sends
  nothing.
