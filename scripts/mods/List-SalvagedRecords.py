List-SalvagedRecords.py

Writes scripts\\mods\\content-salvaged.json: every record Thornswood-Content.esp
carried that Thornswood's own tools did not add, what each one is used by, what
became of it (#2553), and the sha256 of every version of it the repository has
held. Add-ContentRecords.py reads the list to take out what goes, and
tests\\test-2553-salvaged-gone.js reads it to prove nothing salvaged is left.

WHY (#2553)

Until #400 the plugin's header said its crafting and gathering records were
salvaged from another server's plugin, and no permission from that server's
makers is recorded (records\\asset-provenance.json). Patrick, 15 October 2026,
option B on #2177: the salvaged records are remade as Thornswood's own and the
salvaged ones removed.

WHICH RECORDS ARE SALVAGED

The plugin came to this repository on 13 September (commit 0571ad9a, then at
tools\\Thornswood-Content.esp). Thornswood's own tool before the repository,
tools\\thornswood-src\\patch_esp.py, had added the books and menus numbered
0x05E80000 and up (BASE in its content.py): the welcome book, the writs, the
passages and the four menus. Every other record in that copy is salvaged.
Everything added since came from this repository's tools
(Add-ContentRecords.py, Collapse-DwarvenIngots.py), each with its own issue.

So a record is salvaged when its form id is in the 13 September copy and not
in the 0x05E8 range. The editor ids written here are the ones the plugin has
carried since b8e57da renamed them; the old ones carried the other server's
prefix and are not written anywhere.

WHAT IS HASHED

A record's subrecords, inflated when compressed, with its editor id left out:
the same bytes under another name are still the same record. One hash for
every distinct version, read from every commit of the plugin up to
SALVAGED_THROUGH, the last main commit before the remake.

Usage:
    python scripts/mods/List-SalvagedRecords.py           writes the list
    python scripts/mods/List-SalvagedRecords.py --check   exit 1 if it differs
    --masters <Data folder>   where Skyrim.esm and the DLC are read from
                              (default C:\\Thornswood\\Game\\Data)

Needs the repository's full history (the 13 September and 25 September copies
are on their own roots) and the five masters, to say what each override of
Skyrim's own placements did. Read only apart from the list.
