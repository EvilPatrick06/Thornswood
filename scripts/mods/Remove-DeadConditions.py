Remove-DeadConditions.py

Takes conditions out of Thornswood-Content.esp that test for a record which is
about to be deleted, so that Remove-DeadRecords.ps1 can then delete it.

WHY

Patrick, 21 September: "They shouldn't be reading the books it should just be
given to them", and "You level up from working your trade". The sixteen rank
manuals therefore come out of the plugin. Remove-DeadRecords.ps1 refused to
delete three of them, correctly, because three charcoal recipes still point at
them:

    COBJ 0x5015486 ThornswoodRecipeCharcoalTier2 -> 0x501548A WoodcutterAdvanced
    COBJ 0x5015487 ThornswoodRecipeCharcoalTier3 -> 0x501548B WoodcutterExpert
    COBJ 0x5015488 ThornswoodRecipeCharcoalTier4 -> 0x501548C WoodcutterMaster

Each is one CTDA: a condition saying the recipe only appears in the crafting
menu for somebody carrying that book. That is the manual tier gate, in the
plugin, doing in the client's crafting menu what the retired tier system used to
do on the server. It goes for the same reason the rest of it went.

Nothing is left ungated by that. The charcoal grade is the Charburner RANK now,
which burnCharcoal reads directly, and mp.onCraft refuses any recipe the half
and rank on the row do not allow. Build-RecipeTable.ps1 names these three in as
many words as "waiting on somebody putting those books in the world"; they are
not waiting on anything after this, and re-running that script is what puts a
rank on each rung.

WHAT IT PROVES BEFORE IT WRITES

The same discipline as Remove-DeadRecords.ps1, which this borrows its parser
shape from. It parses the file to a tree and
serialises it back byte for byte first, because a parser that cannot reproduce
what it was given has no business editing it. Afterwards it checks the result:
every record is still there, in the same order, with the same form id, type and
flags, and every record's bytes are unchanged except the ones it was asked to
edit, which differ by exactly the conditions removed.

It will not touch a compressed record. None of the records that carry these
conditions is compressed, and silently rewriting something it had to inflate
first is not a thing this should learn to do quietly.

THIS IS A SHIPPED FILE, so its size changing means a release and every client
downloading it again.

Usage:
    python scripts/mods/Remove-DeadConditions.py --check
    python scripts/mods/Remove-DeadConditions.py

Exit code 1 if the parse does not round trip, if the result does not verify, or
if a condition it was asked to remove sits in a compressed record.
