  Find-MissingMasters.ps1

  Reads the TES4 header of every plugin in Data and reports any master that is
  no longer present. A missing master is an instant crash at load, so this is
  the check to run after pulling plugins out of the load order.

  Only the first 8 KB of each file is read. MAST fields always live in the TES4
  record, which is the first record in the file.

  A CHECK THAT FINDS NOTHING MUST NOT SAY EVERYTHING IS FINE.

  Until 23 September this defaulted to the old build folder's Game\Data, a
  folder from before the rename that has not existed on either machine for
  weeks. Run with no arguments it listed an empty folder, compared nothing
  against nothing, and printed "no missing masters. every plugin's dependencies
  are present." in green. Two errors scrolled past above it and the verdict
  underneath was a lie.

  That is the same fault as the launcher's old scan line and as the entry about
  the tests that cannot run: a measurement of nothing reported as a pass. So the
  folder is checked first and an empty one stops this rather than passing it.
