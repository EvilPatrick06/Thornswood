  Rebuild-ContentTables.ps1

  Rebuilds every table that is read out of the plugins of the load order, in
  the order they read each other, after a change to one of Thornswood's own
  plugins in game\content, and says what changed. Issue #2923.

      pwsh scripts/mods/Rebuild-ContentTables.ps1
      pwsh scripts/mods/Rebuild-ContentTables.ps1 -Data D:\Thornswood\Game\Data
      pwsh scripts/mods/Rebuild-ContentTables.ps1 -List

  WHY. Nothing said which tables a content change makes stale, so each change
  found them one red build at a time. Measured on #1382 (#2911, 20 Oct): two
  VPS builds went red after Thornswood-Content.esp gained three teas, first
  on merchant-role-tables.json, then on the merchant bundle inside
  gamemode.js; before those, four harnesses were red on One until their
  tables were rebuilt. docs\systems\station-placement.md named four builders;
  #2911 ran eleven; and the /give names table, which reads every item in the
  load order, was in neither list, so the teas and the furniture items are
  still not in it (counted in gamemode.js's ADMIN_NAMES, 20 Oct).
  Since #2923 every builder reads Thornswood's own plugins from game\content
  (scripts\dev\OwnPlugins.js, OwnPlugins.ps1, own_plugins.py), so a content
  change is built from the repository's plugin with no Data folder made for it.

  WHAT IT RUNS. scripts\mods\content-tables.json, top to bottom: every
  builder that reads a load order, with what each reads and writes, and the
  three that are left out and why. tests\test-2923-own-plugins.js holds that
  list to the builders and its order to what they read. The first builder
  that fails stops the chain; what the ones before it changed is still
  listed. -Data is handed to every builder that takes it; left out, each
  builder uses its own default, which on One is the game at C:\Thornswood.

  THE LOAD ORDER IS THE ONE THE COMMIT RECORDS (#3105). Every builder that
  takes a plugin list is given the load order game\data\npc-population.json
  records, the one both game servers run (Build-NpcPopulation.py reads it
  out of a server's settings when the collection's load order moves), as a
  plugins.txt in a temp folder. Until #3105 each builder read the profile
  list of the PC it ran on: One's Default list held 101 plugins and both
  servers load 103 (Thornswood-Last.esp and _ResourcePack.esl), so main's
  door table still called the gates Last.esp unlocks locked, and a box run,
  given the dev server's list, wrote different tables from One's. Now a PC
  and the box build the same tables from the same commit. -PluginsTxt (the
  box's '{plugins}', the dev server's load order) is held to that record: a
  list that is not the same plugins in the same order stops the run before
  any builder, because the record and the server disagree and the record is
  rebuilt first.

  AFTER THE BUILDERS. records\asset-provenance.json holds each of Thornswood's
  own plugins by sha256, and tests\test-asset-provenance.js refuses a file
  that changed since it was registered. These three are built here, so their
  entries take the new hash; each entry's status, licence and ask stay as
  written, and the line printed for each says the entry's "what" describes
  what the plugin holds, which only the change's author can say.

  WHAT IT SAYS. Every file under game, docs\systems and records, and every
  other file a step writes (tests\fixtures\merchant-retrieval-records.json,
  #3425), that is different from before it ran, by sha256. git diff then shows what each one
  is. The bytes are what git stores because .gitattributes checks every
  builder's output out with LF, as the builders write it (#3029); before it,
  a checkout with autocrlf (One) listed every output a builder wrote, changed
  or not.

  -List prints the steps it would run, with their arguments, and runs none.
