Add-ContentRecords.py

Writes Thornswood-Content.esp's records: every record of Thornswood's own from
the numbers in this script, the overrides of Bethesda's records it carries, and
the cells and worldspaces its placements stand in from Bethesda's own records,
and the placements of Thornswood's kilns, salt quarries, hives and labs from
game\\data\\station-sites.json. Since #2553 nothing in it is the salvaged
plugin's (see THE SALVAGED RECORDS, REMADE, and WHERE THE STATIONS STAND,
below).

THE SALVAGED RECORDS, REMADE (#2553)

Until #400 the plugin's header said its crafting and gathering records were
salvaged from another server's plugin, and no permission from that server's
makers is recorded. Patrick, 15 October 2026, option B on #2177: the salvaged
records are remade as Thornswood's own and the salvaged ones removed.
scripts\\mods\\List-SalvagedRecords.py lists them in
scripts\\mods\\content-salvaged.json, with what became of each:

  remade    the two keywords, the kiln, the alchemy lab, the salt quarry, the
            beehive, the notice board, the four grades of charcoal, their four
            recipes, the pickaxe and the axe. Each is written below from
            Thornswood's rulebook and pointers to Bethesda's own records, its
            form id and editor id kept because the gamemode, the tables and
            the saves name them. Six recipes come out the bytes the plugin
            held, because every field of them is a fact the rulebook states
            (the Charburner and Edgewright pages); the register says which.
  dropped   the other server's placements: its 57 of Thornswood's kiln (8),
            salt quarry (11), hive (13) and alchemy lab (25) at the spots it
            chose, which went on Patrick's A of 16 October when Thornswood
            stood its own; Skyrim's own objects put where it chose and notice
            boards placed switched off; its changes to Skyrim's own
            placements (80 switched off, 32 moved, turned or resized, 3
            relinked, 4 that change nothing); the cells and worldspaces left
            holding nothing of Thornswood's; and a chest of ore nothing names.
  Bethesda's  the salvaged cells and worldspaces a station Thornswood places
            stands in, each written from the winning master's own record by
            Build-LastPlugin.py's copier, never the salvaged copy.

WHERE THE STATIONS STAND (#2553)

Patrick, 16 October 2026, A on #2553: Thornswood measures its own spots for
its kilns, salt quarries, hives and labs, the way the woodworking benches were
placed, and this plugin places them. scripts\\dev\\Build-StationSites.py
measures each spot over the whole load order into game\\data\\station-sites.json
(docs\\systems\\station-placement.md says the rule for each kind); this writes
one placement for each row, its base, its point and its turn and nothing
else, in the cell the row names, under the form id the row gives. A cell or
worldspace a placement needs and the plugin does not carry yet is copied from
the winning master's own record, which needs --masters the first time; the
builder has already refused any spot whose cell a mod changes, so the copy
changes nothing in the game. The placements' form ids start at 0x05015500,
which no version of this plugin ever used, so no change form a save holds for
an old placement can land on a new one.

Before #2553 most of Thornswood's own items here were clones of the salvaged
charcoal and its recipe; they are written from their own numbers now as well.
The tool refuses to write a plugin that holds any salvaged record the
register does not keep, by its bytes under any editor id, or by its form id
for one that left before #2553 (the skill manuals, the Execution Block).
tests\\test-2553-salvaged-gone.js holds the committed plugin to the register.

WHY

Patrick, 21 September: "the woodworker should be able to make handles that the
smith needs for Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes and other items that have wooden handles
like that", on top of "axes, pickaxes and shovels can eventually break and you
have to get a new one from a smith making them".

A tool that breaks has to be replaceable, and the only honest replacement is one
somebody made. Two of the three already are: ThornswoodRecipeWeaponPickaxe and
ThornswoodRecipeWeaponAxe ship in this plugin, both Smith/Edgewright, one iron
ingot each at a forge. The shovel had no recipe at all, so the sentence a farmer
reads when their shovel snaps was not true for them. And nothing anywhere needed
a woodworker, so a smith could make every tool in the game on their own.

So this adds:

    ThornswoodRecipeKeyMold       one iron ingot into a blank key mold.
    ThornswoodRecipeKey           one iron ingot into a key. Since #2487 it carries
                                  NEVER_TRUE, so no forge lists it: a key is cut
                                  and named by the server at the forge's lock key.
                                  Kept, not deleted, so its form id stays taken.
                                  Before that: named server side
                                  for whichever stamped mold is in the pack.

                                  Both added 23 September, at a forge. The
                                  property system's two items had no maker:
                                  the only mold in the world was conjured by
                                  /mold at a door, so the ceremony had to
                                  happen before the object existed and a smith
                                  on their own could never reach a key.
                                  Patrick: "you make a mold, mold gets used on
                                  door to assign mold to the door, than key
                                  uses that mold during crafting to make a key
                                  to specifically that house and it can be
                                  reused".

    ThornswoodMiscToolHandle      the handle itself. A MISC on Skyrim's own
                                  charcoal stick,
                                  Clutter\\Quest\\TG06CharcoalStick.nif: a stick,
                                  which is what a handle looks like. No new mesh
                                  has to ship.
    ThornswoodRecipeToolHandle    the woodworker turns firewood into handles.
    ThornswoodRecipeToolShovel    the smith makes the shovel that had no recipe.

and edits ThornswoodRecipeWeaponPickaxe and ThornswoodRecipeWeaponAxe so that
both of them want a handle as well as the ingot. After this, no tool in the game
exists without a woodworker and a smith between them.

WHICH BENCH THE HANDLE IS MADE AT, AND THE ONE THAT WAS TRIED FIRST

The handle is made at the charcoal kiln, which is a bench woodworkers already
stand at. The sister half rule means a Woodwright gets the novice work of the
Charburner for nothing, so both halves can cut handles.

WHAT WAS TRIED AND TAKEN BACK OUT, because it is worth somebody not trying it
again. The first attempt overrode all three of Skyrim's chopping block FURN
records, turning WBDT from 00ff, not a bench, to 01ff, the create-object bench
the cooking pot and the tanning rack use, so that every chopping block in the
province became a crafting table. Patrick, the same day: "The chopping block
shouldn't be a bench just for getting the firewood and not usable by non
woodworkers and also have the animation script". So the records are Bethesda's
and untouched, and the chopping block is answered server side in gamemode.js by
chopWood instead: the Woodwright's verb, axe required, firewood out.

THE EXECUTION BLOCK, TAKEN OUT OF SOLITUDE (issue #400)

Since #2553 the step that took it out is gone from this tool: the block and
its placement are salvaged records the register says left before #2553, so the
tool refuses a plugin that carries either again. What follows is why it went.

The plugin came from another server, and the last trace of that server's name
in it was a script: FURN 0x05DF7B34, ThornswoodExecutionerChoppingBlock, the
headsman's block placed once in Solitude (REFR 0x05DFCC75), carried a VMAD
attaching the other server's chopping script, named with its prefix, with one
property pointing at Skyrim.esm's executioner swing, IDLE 0x0F95BE. That
script was never in C:\\Thornswood\\Game, the
Steam copy or any pack, measured 20 and 24 September, so it has never run for
anybody here. It is the headsman's block, not a woodcutting one: firewood comes
from the three vanilla chopping blocks, answered server side by chopWood.

Patrick, 28 September, given scenery, the executioner's swing, or removal:
"3. Take it out of Solitude." So this takes the placed reference out of its
cell and, because nothing else points at it, the block's base record as well.
The script goes with it.

WHY REMOVED AND NOT FLAGGED INITIALLY DISABLED AND DELETED. The usual way to
take a reference out of the world is to mark it Initially Disabled, and the
xEdit habit of "undelete and disable" exists for one case: a reference that
belongs to a MASTER, which other plugins may point at, where removing the
override would bring the master's copy back and deleting it outright crashes
anything that still names it. Neither applies here. Both records belong to
this plugin (the 05 at the front of both ids is this file, after its five
masters), no plugin in the game folder lists this one as a master (104 read,
28 September), and nothing in this file or the gamemode names either id. So
the records simply stop existing, which is what Skyrim sees for a form that
was never added, and what an editor does when it removes a record a plugin
itself added. The server's reader (engine\\skymp, WorldState::AttachEspmRecord)
would skip a reference flagged 0x800 or 0x20 as well; it walks groups by their
size fields, which this rewrites, so it reads the smaller file the same way. A
change form the server may have saved for that reference is kept aside and
never loaded (LoadChangeForm defers a form id the plugin does not create, and
skips one whose base is gone), so nothing has to be cleaned out of a save.

THE HEADER'S DESCRIPTION (issue #400, Patrick, 12 October)

The plugin's header carries a description (SNAM), which Vortex and other mod
tools show beside the plugin. Until 12 October it still said the content was
salvaged from the other server, by that server's full name, and was out of
date besides. Patrick's answer B on #400: the description says what the plugin
is for Thornswood, the salvaged records stay, and the other server's name is
mentioned nowhere. So this writes the description into the header, changing
only that subrecord and the header's size, and refuses to write a file whose
header or any record still carries the other server's full name.

Since #2993 the description is built from the records the written plugin
holds. Until then it was one sentence typed into this script, and nothing held
it to the plugin: on 21 October it still listed the skill manuals, which left
on 21 September, and named neither the woodworking bench, the furniture, the
teas, the well and water buckets nor the burnt and fine meals, all added since.
Now each kind of record has a row in CONTENTS with the words that name it. A
row whose records have all left drops out of the description by itself, and a
record no row names stops the tool, so whoever adds a new kind of record says
in the same change how the header names it.

If something ever does point at the base record, the tool keeps the base,
takes only its script off as before, says what points at it, and still takes
the placed reference out. If something points at the placed reference, it
stops and writes nothing.

WHAT IT PROVES BEFORE IT WRITES

The same discipline as Remove-DeadRecords.ps1 and Remove-DeadConditions.py,
whose parser this shares. It serialises the file back
byte for byte before it edits anything. Afterwards it checks that every record
that was there is still there, apart from the ones it was asked to take out, in
the same order, with the same form id, type and flags; that the ones taken out
are gone; that every record it was not asked to touch has the bytes it started with;
that the new records parse back to exactly what was built; that no form id it
allocates is already taken; that the header's record count matches what is
actually in the file; that neither the other server's full name nor either of
its short forms is in the header or in any record's editor id, attached script
or text, and its full name and longer short form in no record's bytes at all,
compressed records included; and that the header changed in its description
and its record count and nowhere else.

It will not touch a compressed record, and it refuses to add a record whose
editor id is already in the file, because two records with one name is the kind
of thing that is found months later.

THE THREE REPAIR KITS (issue #1384)

docs/systems/durability.md: a worn piece is mended with a kit, not at the
grindstone and not at the armour table. Patrick, 4 October, asked for a
suggested recipe for each, written on that page. Cheap, every input from
Skyrim.esm, and every input something a class already supplies at novice,
so the half that makes the kit can get its makings on day one:

    ThornswoodMiscWeaponKit       the Weapon Kit, a MISC.
    ThornswoodMiscArmorKit        the Armor Kit, a MISC.
    ThornswoodMiscSewingKit       the Sewing Kit, a MISC.
    ThornswoodRecipeWeaponKit     1 iron ingot and 1 leather strips, at a forge.
                                  Smith, Edgewright.
    ThornswoodRecipeArmorKit      1 iron ingot and 1 leather, at a forge.
                                  Smith, Platewright.
    ThornswoodRecipeSewingKit     1 tundra cotton and 1 leather strips, at a
                                  tanning rack. Tailor, Haberdasher.

The owner and the half are not readable off a MISC at a forge or a tanning
rack, so all three are named in $RECIPE_OWNER in
scripts/dev/Build-RecipeTable.ps1, the same as the key mold. The rank is the
dearest input, which is novice for all three.

The Sewing Kit was offered as linen wrap and leather strips. Linen wrap is
supplied by no class in this world (game/data/recipes.json says suppliedBy
null for it, measured 4 October), so a Haberdasher could never get one.
Tundra cotton is a gatherer's at novice and is already on the crude pole.
The tanning rack, not the loom, because the loom's keyword is a mod's record
(MCE_CraftingLoom, 6ce000:Update.esm) and these recipes name only Skyrim.esm.

All three MISC records wear Skyrim's charcoal stick, like the handle, so no
new mesh has to ship.

THE FOUR TREATMENTS (issue #1383)

docs/systems/injury.md: a bandage stops a bleed, a splint holds a break, a
poultice cuts the wound fever chance, and a physicker's remedy closes a cut
and clears one ordinary disease. Patrick, 4 October, settled who makes each:
a bandage is a Haberdasher novice recipe at the loom, a splint a Woodwright
novice recipe at the kiln, and the poultice and the remedy Physicker recipes,
novice and advanced. What each one asks for was not said, so these are the
suggested recipes on #1383, every input something a class supplies, the rank
the dearest of them:

    ThornswoodMiscBandage         the Bandage, a MISC.
    ThornswoodMiscSplint          the Splint, a MISC.
    ThornswoodMiscPoultice        the Poultice, a MISC.
    ThornswoodMiscRemedy          the Physicker's Remedy, a MISC.
    ThornswoodRecipeBandage       1 tundra cotton, at the loom. Tailor,
                                  Haberdasher. Novice: a gatherer's cotton.
    ThornswoodRecipeSplint        1 firewood and 1 leather strips, at the kiln.
                                  Woodworker, Woodwright. Novice: the
                                  woodworker's firewood, the hunter's leather.
    ThornswoodRecipePoultice      1 tundra cotton and 1 garlic, at the alchemy
                                  lab. Alchemist, Physicker. Novice: both a
                                  gatherer's at novice.
    ThornswoodRecipeRemedy        1 mudcrab chitin and 1 blue mountain flower,
                                  at the alchemy lab. Alchemist, Physicker.
                                  Advanced: the flower is a gatherer's at
                                  advanced, and the chitin cures disease.

THE LOOM IS A MOD'S BENCH, AND THIS PLUGIN CAN STILL NAME IT. The loom's
keyword is MCE_CraftingLoom, which MoreCraftableEquipment.esp injects into
Update.esm's own numbering as 0x6CE000 (game/data/recipes.json reads it as
6ce000:Update.esm, and the gamemode's TWO_HANDS and BENCH_ACCESS key it the
same way). Update.esm is this plugin's master 01, so 0x016CE000 here is that
keyword, with no new master. The repair kits stayed off the loom because
they named only Skyrim.esm; Patrick asked for the bandage at the loom.

THE ALCHEMY LAB IS THIS PLUGIN'S OWN. ThornswoodCraftingAlchemyWorkbench
(FURN 0x5042E69) is a create-object bench, WBDT 01 10, placed in the apothecary
of each hold capital (WHERE THE STATIONS STAND, above), and carries ThornswoodCraftingAlchemy (KYWD 0x5042E6B), which no recipe named
until now. Skyrim's own alchemy lab cannot show a recipe at all: it brews from
the effects ingredients share. So the physicker's two are made at this one.

The owner and the half are named in $RECIPE_OWNER in
scripts/dev/Build-RecipeTable.ps1, because none of the four can be read off a
MISC at these benches. All four MISC records wear Skyrim's charcoal stick,
like the kits, so no new mesh has to ship.

THE HEARTHFIRE HOUSE PARTS, TAKEN OFF THE FORGE (issue #2258)

Patrick, 25 September: house parts show as craftable "instead of not
existing". Nobody builds a Hearthfire house here: property is a deed and a key
cut from a mold. The server already refuses the four (the 'nobody' rows of
$NOBODY_MAKES in scripts/dev/Build-RecipeTable.ps1, carried into the gamemode's
recipe table), but the forge menu still lists them, because a menu entry is
read on the machine in front of the person from the record, and no server code
reaches it.

So this plugin overrides the four HearthFires.esm recipes, BYOHRecipeNails,
BYOHRecipeHinge, BYOHRecipeLock and BYOHRecipeFittings, and gives each a
condition that is never true: GetItemCount of gold, on the person at the bench,
less than 0. Nobody carries less than no gold, so Skyrim's crafting menu never
lists them, and the server, which has GetItemCount (condition_functions in the
fork), turns the craft down on its own account too if a client ever asks.
Nothing else on the records changes: the same inputs, output, bench and count,
so the override is the record Bethesda wrote plus one line.

The first time, the records are read out of HearthFires.esm in the game's Data
folder (--masters), and their form ids are written in this plugin's numbering
(HearthFires.esm is its master 03 and its own records are 02 in its own file).
Once they are in this plugin, a later run edits them where they are and needs
no game. No later plugin in the load order overrides them (read 11 October
across the main install's load order), so this override is the one that wins.

The other way, the one Collapse-DwarvenIngots.py took for #613, is to drop the
BNAM so no bench lists the recipe. The condition is used here because it keeps
the bench on the record, which is what recipes.json and the gamemode read as
the recipe's bench, and because the server then refuses it too.

THE MASTER KEY (issue #2254)

    ThornswoodMiscMasterKey       one MISC, named per instance in the pack:
                                  "Master key to Breezehome, no. 12". Handed
                                  with the deed at a claim and cut again at a
                                  forge by the server, so no recipe. On the
                                  key's mesh, weightless, worth nothing.

THIS IS A SHIPPED FILE, so its size changing means a release and every client
downloading it again.

THE WOODWORKING BENCH (#516)

Patrick, 12 October 2026: bows, arrows, instruments and fishing poles listed at
the forge are a woodworker's job. Trade ownership was already correct; the forge
menu is wrong because each COBJ's BNAM is still CraftingSmithingForge.

(A) This plugin gets its own woodworking bench: keyword
ThornswoodCraftingWoodworking and furniture ThornswoodCraftingWoodworkingWorkbench,
wearing Hearthfire's carpenter workbench mesh so no new art ships. The 26 recipes
this plugin can already reach (six Skyrim bows, twelve Dawnguard bows/arrows/bolts,
four Dragonborn bows/arrows, and our own three poles plus the fish trap) have their
BNAM pointed at that keyword. The charcoal kiln is not used until #2337 is fixed.

(i) The other 53 rows live in plugins that load after this one (or that would force
a master renumber if added here). scripts/mods/Build-WoodworkerTrailOverrides.py
and woodworker-trail-recipes.json prepare a small trailing plugin for the next
collection revision. Until that ships, the server refusal stays the gate for those.

Placements of the furniture in the world are Claude's: at least one beside a forge
in every major hold and some minor towns. This script only adds the base records.

THE CREATION MENUS, TAKEN OUT (#2962)

Four message boxes were the questions of the first creation flow:
ThornswoodTradeMenu1 and 2 (MESG 0x05E80050, 0x05E80051, "What do you do for a
living?", sixteen trades over two pages) and ThornswoodTownMenu1 and 2 (MESG
0x05E80052, 0x05E80053, "Where do you begin?", ten towns over two pages). Since
20 September the choices are made in the game on K, in the panel the character
block of gamemode.js owns, and since 21 September there is no trade to choose:
rank comes from work. The server could never have shown these boxes anyway:
Message.Show from the gamemode has no actor to show it to (the comment above
CHARGEN in gamemode.js says why).

Measured 21 October: no record in this plugin, Thornswood-Last.esp or
Thornswood-WoodworkerTrail.esp names any of the four, compressed records
included, and Thornswood ships no Papyrus script of its own. Nothing in the
repository named them but Check-Chargen.ps1, which asked for them and their
button counts as if creation needed them.

They stayed because this tool keeps every record it does not write, and
nothing took them out when the flow moved. So RETIRED names them, and a run
takes out any of them the plugin still carries, after checking each is the
MESG of that editor id. Nothing keeps a change form for a message box, so no
save or server state names their form ids.

# that made "every building in the game is claimable" affordable: Inventory::Entry
# in the fork carries an optional per-instance name, serialised by name in
# Inventory.h, so one BOOK becomes "Deed to Breezehome" or "Deed to Honeyside" in
# the pack without a record per building. There are 852 claimable buildings and
# this is one record rather than 852.

# A KEY AND A KEY MOLD, AND WHY BOTH ARE MISC RATHER THAN KEYM.
#
# Skyrim has a record type for keys and this does not use it. A KEYM lands in the
# Keys tab, which is a list the game treats as yours: a vanilla key is weightless,
# is not dropped, and is not what a pickpocket takes.
#
# Patrick, 21 September, on what a key is for here: it "can be given to people
# used by you or pickpocketed or taken out of unlocked chests or lockpicked", and
# "a stolen key only gets you in". Every one of those is a thing a MISC does and a
# KEYM does not. So a key here is an object somebody carries and can lose, which
# is the whole point of it, and the Keys tab is the wrong home for it.
#
# Both are one record for the whole game, named per instance in the pack exactly
# as the deed is: "Key to Breezehome", "Key mold for Honeyside".

# mold". Both now wear vanilla meshes from Skyrim.esm, so still no new art ships:
# the key the 191 KEYM records in Skyrim.esm use most, and the silver mold the

# THE NOTICE BOARD AND THE HOLD'S DROP BOX (#2298).
#
# ThornswoodMessageBoard, the activator every board in the world is, named a
# reworked copy of the board in Missives (Nexus 111375) that came with the other
# server's records, MissiveBoardCOTND.nif in a folder named with that server's
# prefix. Patrick, 12 Oct,
# chose Thornswood's own board built from vanilla pieces, with the hold's drop
# box on a shelf on its right post, as two objects placed together: "when they
# click on the Notice Board it does the Notice Board and when they click on the
# dropbox it does just the dropbox". scripts/mods/Build-NoticeBoard.py builds
# both meshes, and they ship as ours from game/ours.
#
# So the board's MODL moves to the new mesh, its OBND to the new mesh's bounds
# (the old one's were Missives' board), and the box is an activator of its own,
# ThornswoodDropBox, written the same way as the board.
#
# WHY AN ACTIVATOR AND NOT A CONTAINER. Patrick, 12 Oct: a person sees only what
# they put in, gold included, and only the hold's officers see everything. A
# Skyrim container shows whoever opens it everything in it, and the server sends
# a container's whole inventory to every client that has it in view. So what is
# in the box is the server's record, the server stands the box beside its board
# (standBoard in game/gamemode.js, #2516), and E on it opens the box's own

# and names in this section. Nothing is read out of the plugin it rewrites,
# and nothing is cloned from a salvaged record: before #2553 most of
# Thornswood's own items here were clones of the salvaged charcoal and its
# recipe, and the station records were the salvaged ones. The deed is still
# made from Thornswood's own passage book, and the catches from Skyrim's clam. See the top of
# scripts\mods\List-SalvagedRecords.py for which records were salvaged, and
# scripts\mods\content-salvaged.json for what became of each.

# WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN. A field that only points at Bethesda's game, a mesh
# path, a keyword, a sound, an ingredient, the bounds and furniture markers of
# the vanilla object whose mesh it wears, is taken from that vanilla record and
# named beside it here. That is Bethesda's, not the other server's. A field
# that is a choice, the name, what a recipe takes and makes and where, what an
# item is worth, whether a bench makes things, is Thornswood's and comes from
# its rulebook (docs/systems), named beside it too. What the salvaged records
# carried and Thornswood's design does not ask for is not written: the
# editor-only colours of the keywords and markers, the empty texture lists,
