  Enable-MCM.ps1

  RETIRED. DO NOT RUN. Issue #1179: patched SkyUI_SE.esp's light flag by hand. The collection (or the settled load order) does this now. It refuses to run, and the rest of the file is kept for the history of how it was installed. Pattern from #405 Add-Bodies.

  What it used to do, and what is left of it:

  The chain that was blocking it:

    QuickLootIE.esp    light,     masters Skyrim.esm      - a 527 byte stub
    SkyUI_SE.esp       light,     masters Skyrim.esm      - holds 7 MCM quests
    MCMHelper.esp      NOT light, masters SkyUI_SE.esp    - the shared MCM quest

  Every MCM Helper mod uses the quest inside MCMHelper.esp; they do not carry
  their own. So QuickLoot's dialog is telling the truth, the quest really is not
  in the game.

  MCMHelper.esp cannot go in the server's load order while its master is light,
  because a light plugin has no normal index and the server's reader refuses a
  plugin whose master is absent. And it cannot be switched on client side alone,
  because then the two lists disagree and every mod form resolves to the wrong
  object.

  So the light flag comes off SkyUI_SE.esp. One bit in its header. It then takes
  a normal index, goes server side, and MCMHelper.esp follows it.

  Its 7 records are SkyUI's own config quests. Moving them out of FE space
  changes their form ids, which the engine fixes up by itself: dependent plugins
  name their masters by filename and are resolved at load. The one real cost is
  to a local save that referenced them, and Thornswood characters live on the
  server, not in a local save.

  The original is kept beside it. Nothing here is one way.
