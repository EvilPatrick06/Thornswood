  Check-Manifest.ps1

  Says what load order the game server is actually handing out, and how it
  compares to the one you play with.

      .\scripts\mods\Check-Manifest.ps1
      .\scripts\mods\Check-Manifest.ps1 -Full     print both lists in full
      .\scripts\mods\Check-Manifest.ps1 -Dev      the dev server against the dev build

  -Dev exists because until 22 September this could not be pointed at the dev
  server at all. It finds the root by listing C:\ on the VPS and taking the
  first folder that holds a server-settings.json, which is C:\Thornswood-Server,
  and it compared against C:\Thornswood, the main build. So the one question
  worth asking about the dev server, whether its load order is still the one
  people are playing, had no way to be asked. On that day the answer was no: 60
  plugins against the game's 57, parting company at position 7, and four things
  for the launcher's scan to find before Play would come back.

  Why it matters: SkyMP's client compares the server's manifest against your
  plugin list position by position. One plugin out of place and the person is
  turned away with a load order error that says nothing useful. Before building
  a Nexus collection, the list in here is the thing that has to be matched, and
  a stale copy on a client is not evidence of anything.
