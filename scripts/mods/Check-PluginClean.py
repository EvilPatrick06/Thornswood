Check-PluginClean.py

Says whether Thornswood's own plugins are clean: no record left identical to
the master it overrides, no deleted reference, and no fault in the file
itself. It is the check SSEEdit's Check for Errors and its cleaning filter
were run for, done from the files, so it runs on any machine with Python.

WHY (issue #2790)

The weekly review of 19 October opened #2790: three plugins changed that week
(Thornswood-Content.esp, Thornswood-Last.esp, Thornswood-WoodworkerTrail.esp)
and each needed an SSEEdit check for stray identical records, deleted
references and errors before the next main release. SSEEdit only runs on
Windows, with a window and somebody clicking, so the issue said "this waits
on One". Every one of the three is written by a script in this repository and
changes most weeks (five merges changed the content plugin on 20 October
alone), so a check that needs a person at One's desk is a check that waits
every week. This one is the same questions asked of the bytes.

WHAT IT CHECKS

  The file      Every group and record lies inside the group around it and
                the file; every record's subrecords add up to its size; a
                compressed record inflates to the size it says; no record has
                form id 0 or a file index past the plugin's own; no form id is
                in the file twice; a light (ESL flagged) plugin adds records
                only in 0x800 to 0xFFF; HEDR's next object id is past every
                record the plugin adds.

  Deleted       Any record flagged deleted (0x20). A placed reference (REFR,
                ACHR and the other placed kinds) that overrides a master's is
                a deleted reference, which crashes anything that still names
                it; SSEEdit's clean undeletes and disables it. Our writers
                never delete: they take a record out of the file, or mark a
                master's reference initially disabled (Build-LastPlugin.py).

  Identical     With the masters: every record that overrides one, held to
  to master     the version it overrides, the last of the plugin's own
                masters that has it, the way SSEEdit's Quick Auto Clean loads
                a plugin with its masters. Identical means the same record
                flags (compression aside) and the same subrecords in the same
                order, where a form id counts as the same when it names the
                same record through each file's own master list (equal bytes
                can name different records, and different bytes the same
                one), and a localised string counts as the same text when
                the master's string table holds exactly the plugin's plain
                text. A cell or
                worldspace that is identical but holds records of the plugin
                is the parent those records need, and is not something to
                clean; SSEEdit skips those too.

  Masters       With the masters: each one is there, and each master's own
                masters come before it in the plugin's list.

  References    With the masters: the fields every one of these plugins uses
                to name another record (a placed reference's base, keywords,
                a recipe's result, bench and items, a cell's location, owner,
                water, climate, music and lighting, a location's parent, link
                and enable parents) name a record that exists in the plugin
                or one of its masters.

WHAT IT DOES NOT

  SSEEdit's Check for Errors reads every field through its definition of
  every record type, so it also catches a reference to a record of the wrong
  type, a reference in a field not listed above (conditions, scripts, quest
  aliases), and values out of range. This does not have those definitions.
  The fields it does read are the ones the three writers produce.

  Without the definitions it cannot say which bytes are form ids, so it
  reads the four byte words where every form id field the writers produce
  sits, and takes a word for a form id only when it names a record that
  exists. A script (VMAD) puts form ids at any byte, so a script that the
  master numbers differently counts as changed. Both of those lean towards
  calling a record changed: the one way a changed record could read as
  identical is a value that is not a form id, differs between the two files
  by exactly the move of a file index, and also reads as a record that
  exists. Read the record before taking it out of its writer.

  The header's record count is #2789 (two writers count records and leave
  the groups out); SSEEdit rewrites that number when it saves and never
  reports it, so this does not either.

WHERE IT RUNS

  Without the game (--no-masters) it reads only the plugins: the file and
  deleted checks. Every pull request runs that (.github/workflows/build-pr.yml)
  over game/content, so a writer that leaves a broken or deleted record goes
  red before it merges. The masters are Bethesda's and the collection's mods'
  plugins, which live in a game folder; the full check runs where one is:

    python scripts/mods/Check-PluginClean.py
    python scripts/mods/Check-PluginClean.py --data "C:\\Thornswood\\Game\\Data"
    python scripts/mods/Check-PluginClean.py --no-masters
    python scripts/mods/Check-PluginClean.py --data D:\\Data Thornswood-Last.esp

  With no plugin named it checks every plugin in game/content. Thornswood's
  own plugins are always read from game/content (scripts/dev/own_plugins.py),
  the masters from --data. Read only. Exit 0 when every plugin is clean, 1 on
  any finding, 2 when it could not check (a master missing, a file it cannot
  read).

CLEANING

  When this finds something, the cure is in the writer that made the record,
  not in an editor: the plugins are rebuilt by their scripts and an edit by
  hand is lost at the next build. Content: Add-ContentRecords.py. Last:
  Build-LastPlugin.py. Woodworker trail: Build-WoodworkerTrailOverrides.py.
