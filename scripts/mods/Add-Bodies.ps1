  Add-Bodies.ps1

  RETIRED. DO NOT RUN. Issue #405: every run poured the nude CBBE and 3BA
  female body (femalebody_0.nif and _1.nif, shapes 3BA, 3BA_Vagina and
  3BA_Anus, no Bra or Panty) back over Game\Data, whatever body had been
  put there since. It is also from before the own game folder: those meshes
  are Vortex hard links now (Profile\OwnGame\files.txt records them as L|V),
  so a run wrote straight into Vortex's own staging copy, and
  Publish-Update never packs a Vortex deployed file, so nothing it wrote
  would ship anyway. The bodies come from the Nexus collection, and the
  covered female body goes in there, as a collection revision, the way
  every other mesh reaches everybody. It refuses to run, and the rest of
  the file is kept for the history of how it was installed. Pattern from
  #735 Add-TempleRespawn and #768 Add-JContainers.

  What it used to do, and what is left of it:

  Bodies, genitals and physics. Skeleton, female body, male body, and the
  jiggle that hangs off both.

  Installed in this order because each one writes over the last: skeleton
  first, then the bodies, then the physics that needs them both.

  Two of these archives are FOMOD installers with mutually exclusive option
  folders. Where the right option is known it is named below with the reason.
  Where an archive turns out to have a shape this script does not recognise
  it stops and prints what it found, rather than copying every option over
  the top of every other one and leaving a body that is quietly wrong.
