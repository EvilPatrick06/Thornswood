  LoadOrder.ps1

  The load order as the game counts it, and how to put a plugin list into the
  server's order. Dot-sourced by Publish-Update.ps1, so the reference plugin
  list that goes into a pack ships in the order the server actually runs.

  The same rule as launcher\app\LoadOrder.cs in the launcher, function for
  function, and the two are held to identical output by a test. Change one,
  change the other.

  The game hands a normal index to the five masters, then to every plugin
  Skyrim.ccc names that is in Data, then to every enabled entry of plugins.txt
  that is in Data. Light plugins (an .esl, or the ESL flag in the header) get
  no normal index and are skipped throughout. The client compares that list
  with the server's manifest position by position, and one name out of place
  is LOAD ORDER ERROR for the session.

  Light plugins have an order of their own (#1715): a light index is a
  plugin's place among the light plugins the game loads, and every form in it
  is 0xFE000000 | (index << 12) | local id. Get-LoadOrderLight is that order,
  and Get-LoadOrderReordered with the names the game loads first puts a list
  into the server's whole order, light plugins included, the way
  LoadOrder.LightOrder and LoadOrder.Reorder do in the launcher.

<#
  Which revision of the collection this machine has installed, or 0.

  The same rule as Checks.CollectionRevision in the launcher, and it is here
  because the SHIPPING machine's answer is the one that goes in the feed: the
  server's load order and the reference plugin list are both derived from this
  machine's Vortex deployment, so the revision it is on is the revision the
  release agrees with.

  Found on 22 September, and this is why it exists: this machine was on
  revision 2 while the collection on Nexus was on 4. Nothing said so, because
  the only test was whether one named file existed and that file was not in
  the collection at all. Two revisions of drift, on the machine that builds
  the server.

  WHERE THE NUMBER COMES FROM, and why this was rewritten on 27 September.
  The first version read the revision out of the name Vortex gave the mod
  folder:

      %APPDATA%\Vortex\skyrimse\mods\collection_ombo2a_2_2026-09-15T21-08-00Z
                                                slug  ^ revision

  Current Vortex does not name the folder that way any more. It names it for
  the mod id it made up, with no slug and no number in it at all:

      %APPDATA%\Vortex\skyrimse\mods\vortex_collection_ZRT7NjhN_

  So the folder name stopped being able to answer the question, Have went to
  0 on every up to date machine, Get-CollectionState.Known went false, and
  Deploy-Gamemode's revision gate refused every deploy unless -IgnoreRevision.

  The honest source is Vortex's own state, not the folder name. When Vortex
  installs a collection it records, against the mod, the slug it was installed
  from and the revision NUMBER it is on. That is independent of what the folder
  is called, so it answers for both eras. It is read the same way
  Get-CollectionNewest reads state.v2, through the read-only LevelDB reader
  (#1582, #1902), which opens no database handle and takes no lock. The old
  folder-name parse stays as a fallback for a machine that only has the legacy
  folders and no readable state.

  Vortex's export archives under an installed collection's staging folder,

  WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured on the shipping machine on 27 September against
  collection 7essxf: the installed folder
  %APPDATA%\Vortex\skyrimse\mods\vortex_collection_ZRT7NjhN_ holds NO loose
  collection.json. The JSON is inside export\collection_0.7z, which is what
  Vortex writes when the collection is authored on the machine rather than
  subscribed to. Check-CollectionRules looked only for the loose file, so on
  that machine it stopped with "no collection.json at ...\collection.json"
  and exited 1 unless somebody unpacked the archive and passed -Collection.

  Best first means: the export folder before the staging folder's own root,
  a name starting with collection before any other name, and the newest
  write time before an older one. In the staging folder's own root only a
  collection* name counts, because anything else there is a mod's archive

  was tied to a mod or a slug, so any mod whose version went from one whole
  number to another counted as a revision. The newestVersion Vortex keeps on
