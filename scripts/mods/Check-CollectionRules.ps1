  Whether the plugin rules the Nexus collection carries hold a clean install
  to a plugin list's order. Entry 274 on the To Do List.

  WHY IT EXISTS. Revisions 2 to 4 of the collection carried no plugin rules at
  all, so a first-time person installed, got whatever order LOOT picked,
  pressed Play and was refused. Revision 5, on 22 September, carries 51 "load
  after" rules, one chain over the 52 full plugins from Water for ENB.esm to
  Playable Rieklings.esp. LOOT treats those as hard constraints, so a sort can
  put other plugins between them but cannot swap two of them, and that day a
  Sort Now put all 52 in exactly the server's order.

  What the chain cannot do is look after itself. The entry says it plainly: "A
  PLUGIN ADDED LATER IS NOT PINNED UNTIL SOMEBODY GIVES IT A RULE. ... Forget
  that and the new plugin floats, which is the same load order mismatch this
  entry exists to stop, arriving one revision later with nobody connecting
  the two." Nothing read the rules against a list, so nothing would have said
  so. This does. It says NO, and exits 1, for any of four things:

    - a full plugin the list enables that no rule names. It floats. The next
      upload needs a rule loading it after the full plugin above it.
    - a rule the list breaks: a plugin listed above the one it must load after.
    - two full plugins next to each other that no chain of rules keeps in that
      order, so LOOT is free to swap them.
    - a full plugin a rule names that the list does not enable, which means
      the collection and the list disagree about what is in the order.

  Light plugins (an .esl, or the ESL flag in the header, read out of the Data
  folder) are left out, because the server's position check leaves them out
  and LOOT moving one changes nothing it counts. So are the five base masters,
  which the game loads first whatever any list says. Only "after" and
  "before" rules are read. A collection that ordered plugins by LOOT groups
  instead would be reported as floating: a false alarm, never a quiet pass.

  MEASURED 24 SEPTEMBER on Patrick's machine, against revision 5. The list the
  dev server runs (the 23 September 22:46 dev pack's profile\plugins.txt,
  byte for byte the same as %LOCALAPPDATA%\Skyrim Special Edition\plugins.txt)
  passes: 94 enabled, 52 full, all 52 named, 51 pairs held. The reference copy
  this defaults to, Profile\Default\plugins.txt, does NOT: it was rewritten at
  22:39 on 23 September with Thornswood-Content.esp moved from line 31 to the
  end, which breaks "Populated Cities Towns Villages Legendary.esp loads after
  Thornswood-Content.esp". Publish-Update put it back in the server's order
  for the pack, so nobody received it, but it is what this machine holds.

  WHERE THE COLLECTION.JSON COMES FROM, corrected 27 September. A subscribed
  install leaves it loose in the staging folder. An AUTHORED collection, which
  is what the shipping machine has, leaves no loose copy at all: the only one
  is inside export\collection_0.7z. Measured that morning, this stopped with
  "no collection.json at ...\vortex_collection_ZRT7NjhN_\collection.json" and
  exited 1 on the one machine it matters most on, and the only way past it was
  to unpack the archive by hand and pass -Collection. Get-CollectionJsonPath
  in LoadOrder.ps1 now reads either shape.

  Read only where it matters. It reads Vortex's copy of the collection, one
  plugin list and the plugin headers in one Data folder, and writes nothing
  into any of them. The one thing it writes is the collection.json it unpacks
  out of an export archive, into a temp folder keyed by that archive's size
  and write time, so a second run costs nothing. With no revision of the
  collection installed in Vortex it says SKIP and exits 0, so it can run on a
  machine without Vortex.
