  ServerHold.ps1

  A hold: a server stopped on purpose says so, and the watchdog leaves it
  stopped until the hold ends (#5155).

  WHY. The watchdog on the box (Watch-Services.ps1, the Thornswood Watch task,
  every five minutes) starts any server that is not answering. It had no way
  to know a stop was on purpose. On 31 Oct 2026 the live server was stopped at
  about 4:00 PM so its merchant ledger could be swapped before a new gamemode
  went on, and at 4:01:24 PM the watchdog started the old gamemode again,
  which read the new ledger and failed on it; the dev server the same at
  3:01:24 PM. Patrick's answer the same day (A): whoever stops a server on
  purpose leaves a hold beside it, saying who, why and until when, 30 minutes
  unless they say otherwise and 2 hours at most. The watchdog leaves a held
  server alone until the hold ends, then tells staff once and starts it. A
  crash, with no hold, is restarted straight away as before.

  WHERE. One file per server in C:\Thornswood-Watch\holds, named by the
  server's task or service name with everything but letters and digits made a
  dash: 'Thornswood Server' is Thornswood-Server.json, 'ThornswoodBot' is
  ThornswoodBot.json. It holds target, by, why, set and until, the two times
  in unix seconds. The watchdog reads it (ReadHold in Watch-Services.ps1) and
  takes 2 hours from when the file was written as the most it will wait,
  whatever until says, so a hold can never keep a server down longer than
  that. tests\test-5155-server-holds.ps1 writes holds with these functions and
  reads them with the watcher's own code, so the two cannot drift apart.

  WHO USES IT. Its text goes in front of what runs on the box, the way
  StopAndMove.ps1's does: Swap.ps1 puts it in front of both swap blocks
  (Deploy-Server, Deploy-DevGamemode, Deploy-Docs, Install-Voice,
  Install-Bot), and Restart-Server, Reset-Character, Deploy-Docs,
  Install-Bridge, Install-Voice, Install-Gate, Install-AdminService,
  Bot-Service (through Install-Bot), Setup-Domain, Wipe-Saves and Go send it
  with their own stops. Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 and vps-freeze.ps1 run on
  the box and carry a copy between marker lines; the test fails when a copy
  differs. A stop by hand in a run note uses Hold-Server.ps1, which sends it
  the same way.

  Each script writes its hold just before it stops the server and removes it
  once it has started it again (and, where the script waits for it, once it
  answers or the wait is over), or has given up and left it to the
  watchdog. A script that dies in between leaves the hold, and the watchdog
  starts the server when it runs out and says so in #staff-updates.

  Keep it ASCII and Windows PowerShell 5.1: the box reads a file with no byte
  order mark as ANSI.
