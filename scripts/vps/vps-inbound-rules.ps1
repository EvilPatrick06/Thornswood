.SYNOPSIS
  Runs ON THE VPS, sent there by Set-InboundRules.ps1: turns off every enabled inbound Allow firewall rule that is not on the box's list, and says which (#3807).

.DESCRIPTION
  Do not run this by hand. Set-InboundRules.ps1 sends this file's text on
  ssh's standard input with the list from records\prod-parity.json
  ("inboundRules"), and Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs it from there, so
  nothing of it is ever written on the box (#3035).

  WHY. Issue #3807, measured 26 Oct 2026. Bootstrap-VPS.ps1,
  vps-dev-instance.ps1, Setup-Domain.ps1, Install-Voice.ps1, Deploy-Docs.ps1
  and Set-WebFirewall.ps1 each add, scope or take away the rules they own.
  Nothing owned the rest, so whatever Windows Server enables by default, and
  every rule made by hand before the scripts, stayed on: "Allow WinRM HTTPS"
  on TCP 5986 from any address, two old copies of the game rules, and the
  Windows defaults for Delivery Optimization, DIAL, Cast to Device, AllJoyn,
  Teredo, IPHTTPS and mDNS. This is the owner of the rest: the list names
  every rule the box keeps, and anything else enabled is turned off.

  In this order, each step saying what it found:

    the list      every entry a rule's Name or DisplayName. An empty list
                  stops it.
    the rules     every enabled inbound Allow rule, one RULE line each,
                  KEPT (on the list) or OUTSIDE (not on it), with its group,
                  protocol, ports, remote addresses and program.
    the required  every entry the list marks required (the game, the dev
                  game and the web rules) is there and enabled. With -Apply
                  one missing stops it before anything is turned off, since
                  an old copy turned off would then be the only way in.
    who made it   for each OUTSIDE rule, its own properties (where it is
                  stored, its group, its description) and every "rule added"
                  or "rule changed" event the firewall's own log still
                  holds for it, with the account and program that made it.
    WinRM         the WinRM service's state and its listeners, as the
                  service says them.
    IPv6          every IPv6 address but link-local, with its interface, so
                  a tunnel (Teredo, 6to4, IP-HTTPS) in use shows before its
                  rule is turned off.
    listeners     what listens on every interface, TCP and UDP, with the
                  process.
    the change    with -Apply, each OUTSIDE rule turned off (never deleted,
                  so Enable-NetFirewallRule puts one back) and read back. A
                  rule that takes TCP port 22 is never touched: ssh's rules
                  are Set-SshScope.ps1's, and the bridge comes in through
                  them.

  Every line of output starts with one word: LIST, RULE, REQUIRED, ORIGIN,
  EVENT, WINRM, ADDRESS, LISTEN, CHANGED, WOULD (with -DryRun), ALREADY, LEFT, STOP or
  DONE. STOP means nothing after it was done, and the exit code is 1. With
  -Check the exit code is 2 when any rule is OUTSIDE or a required one is
  missing, so the check fails on a rule nobody listed.

  THE WAY BACK. A rule this turned off is still on the box, disabled:
      Enable-NetFirewallRule -Name '<its Name, from the CHANGED line>'

.PARAMETER Check
  Read all of it and change nothing.

.PARAMETER Apply
  Turn off every enabled inbound Allow rule that is not on the list.

.PARAMETER List
  The list, as base64 of UTF-8 JSON: an array of { "rule": ..., "required":
  true|false }. Set-InboundRules.ps1 makes it from records\prod-parity.json.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  With -Apply: read everything and say WOULD for each change.

.PARAMETER Layer
  A file that replaces the functions below that touch Windows. Only
  tests\test-3807-inbound-rules.ps1 passes it.
