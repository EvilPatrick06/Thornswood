  Send-Secret.ps1

  How a secret goes to the VPS: on ssh's standard input, never on a command
  line. Dot-source it beside Vps.ps1:

      . (Join-Path $Here '..\vps\Send-Secret.ps1')
      Invoke-ThornswoodSecretRemote -Target "$User@$Vps" -SshArgs $ssh -Secret $value -Script @"
      `$pw = `$ThornswoodSecret; `$ThornswoodSecret = `$null
      ...
      "@

  The script that runs on the VPS finds the value in $ThornswoodSecret. The
  script itself names no secret, so it can go the usual way.

  WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #451). Every script here that sent a secret (the
  server password, the site password, the bot token and the site's bot key,
  the Discord client secret, a webhook, the build runner's registration token)
  base64'd it into the remote script, and the remote script went to ssh as
  powershell -NoProfile -EncodedCommand <that>. So the value sat in the command
  line of ssh on this machine and of cmd.exe and powershell.exe on the VPS for
  the length of the call, where the process list, a process creation audit
  event or anything reading Win32_Process could see it. Base64 is transport
  encoding and hides nothing. Over 6,000 characters the script went as a file
  in C:\Windows\Temp instead, and then the value sat in a file on both
  machines. Comments beside two of them said the value was never on a command
  line on either machine, which was not true.

  HOW. The value is base64'd (so no quoting, code page or byte order mark can
  change it) and written to ssh's standard input. ssh carries its standard
  input to the remote command's, cmd.exe hands it on to powershell, and the
  first line of the remote script reads one line of it. Only the script goes
  on the command line, and when it is too long for that, it goes by scp and
  its run deletes the copy before it runs (Send-Script.ps1, #3059), while the
  value still goes on standard input: never on a command line and never in a
  file. Standard input reaches the box whole only up to about 8 KB, measured
  21 Oct 2026, so a value over 8,000 bytes is refused before anything is sent. Watch-Services.ps1 -Webhook has sent
  the alerts webhook this way since 28 September.

  Measured on this machine on 29 September, in Windows PowerShell 5.1 and in
  PowerShell 7: a value piped into powershell -EncodedCommand this way arrives
  whole, and no process command line holds it while the script runs
  (tests\test-secret-channel.ps1 repeats that on every run).

  Never print the value, including in an error message.
