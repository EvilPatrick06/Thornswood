  Says how long the launcher took to start on the machines of the people who
  played, per launcher version: how many starts, the middle one, the one
  slower than nine in ten, the slowest, and how much of the middle start the
  mod check took. Issue #3534.

  WHY THIS EXISTS. The weekly review measures the launcher's start time
  (its Performance area), and the 25 Oct 2026 review could not: "the
  launcher is never started" by a Claude, and nothing else measured it.
  Since #3534 the launcher writes one line to Profile\launcher.log once its
  window has drawn (Shell.cs, LogStartTime):

      2026-10-27 19:04:11  Launcher start: the window was on screen 2.4 s after the launcher started, 0.8 s of it the mod check, on launcher 1.2.6.

  The launcher already sends the last 256 KB of launcher.log to the site when
  a session ends (the privacy page, "The launcher's own log"), and the site
  keeps each set in C:\Thornswood-Docs\data\session-logs\<session>.json. So
  the starts testers really had are on the box, from their own machines,
  which is the number that matters, and this reads them there.

  HOW IT COUNTS. Every set written in the window is read, and every start line
  in its launcher.log whose own time is in the window. One launcher.log runs
  across several sessions, so the same line comes in more than one set; a
  line is counted once per account and time. Sets that will not read are
  counted and skipped. No account, name or address is printed: only counts
  and seconds.

  Reads only. Opens the folder's files, writes nothing, connects to nothing.
  Runs in Windows PowerShell 5.1 on the box and in pwsh anywhere.
  tests\test-3534-launcher-starts.ps1 runs it against sets of its own.

  Exits 0 with the table (or "no starts in the window" and how many sets were
  read), 1 when the folder is not there.
