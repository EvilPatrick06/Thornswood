  Get-Logs.ps1

  Brings the server's own logs down to this machine so they can be read whole.

  Chargen-Log.ps1 already asks the VPS a set of questions and prints the
  answers. That is the right shape when you know what you are looking for. It
  is the wrong shape when you do not: a filter can only ever return the lines
  somebody already thought to search for, and the line that explains a problem
  is almost never one of them. The second and third time a bug has been chased
  here it was a line nobody would have grepped for, sitting next to one that
  was.

  So this one filters nothing. It copies the tail of each log into
  Thornswood-Repo\logs and tells you where it put them.

      .\Get-Logs.ps1                pull the last 4000 lines of each
      .\Get-Logs.ps1 -Lines 40000   pull a lot more
      .\Get-Logs.ps1 -All           pull the whole thing, however big it is

  What comes back:

      site.log      the website, the Discord door and the launcher check in
      bot.log       the Discord bot, the panel and the site watcher
      server.log    the game server, which is where character creation,
                    connections, item handouts and gamemode errors are
      thornswood.log the gamemode lines without the engine noise
      door.log      the door: who it let in and what the site said
      voice.log     the voice and register service
      health.json   what the voice service says about itself right now

  For every log that rolls (server, thornswood, voice, site, bot), its
  rolled generations come down too, under the same names: the box is asked
  once which of them it has, and exactly those are read, so a pull never
  asks for a file that is not there. The rollers keep five, so that is .1
  through .5 at most, except server.log, which server-log.js rolls by its
  time since #2349 (server.log.<when>, up to 30 days of them, newest first).
  door.log does not roll, so only the current file is fetched.

  Nothing on the VPS is changed. Everything here is a read.

  WHAT THE BOX HAS, asked once (#1605).

  This used to make up the names: every log that rolls got .1 through .5
  added to the list, and each one was asked for by name whether the box had
  it or not, with a MISSING answer for the ones it did not. On 4 October that
  was 15 of the 31 asks on a dev pull (thornswood, site and bot had no
  rolled copies there), and the MISSING answer is what the case bug below
  wrote down as a log. So the box is asked one question first, which of
  these files it has, and the pull reads exactly those and nothing else.

  The answer is full paths, one to a line: the current file when it is
  there, and Name.<number> beside it for a log that rolls.

  What the service says about itself. Small, and it is the fastest way to tell
  a stale process from a fresh one, which has cost days here before.

  THROUGH THE SITE FIRST, BECAUSE THAT IS HOW EVERYTHING ELSE REACHES IT.

  This asked http://<vps>:7778/health and nothing else, and on 21 and 22
  September it printed "no answer from <live>:7778" on every pull.
  That read as the voice service being down. It was not: measured on
  22 September, https://thornswood.net/voice/health answers 200 and says

      {"ok":true,"build":"owners-5","auth":"on","bind":"127.0.0.1", ...}

  bind is 127.0.0.1. The service is deliberately on loopback with Caddy
  carrying /voice/, which is exactly what Install-Voice's own -Bind parameter
  describes, and the raw port is therefore shut from outside ON PURPOSE. Both
  services were healthy the entire time this said they were not.

  A check that cries wolf is worse than no check, because the next real outage
  reads as the same yellow line everybody has learned to scroll past. So the
  site is asked first, the raw port is the fallback for a box with no Caddy in
  front of it, and the answer's own bind is printed so the shape of the
  install is visible rather than inferred.
