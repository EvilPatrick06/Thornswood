.SYNOPSIS
  Lists the GitHub Actions jobs one runner started after a given time, with how each ended and which step failed, and says whether one of them passed; read-only (issue #2161).

.DESCRIPTION
  The outbound limits of #2161 go on one VPS runner account at a time, and
  each is proven by a job that runner then runs green before the next one
  goes on (docs\RUNNER-ISOLATION.md section 6). All the runners carry the
  same labels, so a job cannot be sent to one of them: this reads what each
  did instead, by the runner_name GitHub records on every job.

  It reads with GET calls only (gh api): the runs created from -LookBack
  hours before -Since, because a job queued before the rules went on may
  start after, then each run's jobs. A job counts when its runner is
  -Runner and it started at or after -Since, and, with -Job, when its name
  holds that text: a board card job reaches only GitHub's API, so a build
  runner's limits are proven by a build (-Job 'Launcher builds').

  Exit 0 when at least one such job ended success, 2 when none has yet.
  Failed and cancelled jobs are listed with their failed steps for a person
  to read: a harness that is red on its own branch fails on every runner,
  so a failure alone says nothing about the runner.
