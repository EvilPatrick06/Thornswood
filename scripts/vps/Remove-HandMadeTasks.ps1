  Remove-HandMadeTasks.ps1

  Takes the two SYSTEM tasks somebody made by hand on the box, and the folders
  they run from, off the box (issue #3288). Runs ON the VPS, as Administrator,
  through Remote.ps1.

      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Remove-HandMadeTasks.ps1 -Arguments '-WhatIf'
      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Remove-HandMadeTasks.ps1

  WHAT THEY ARE, read on the box on 27 Oct 2026. Both run as SYSTEM, Highest,
  and neither has a trigger: each was started by hand, and nothing in the
  repository made either one.
    Thornswood Maint Update
      powershell.exe -File C:\Thornswood-Maint\update.ps1. It asked Windows
      Update for everything not installed, installed all of it, wrote a five
      minute restart into the live server's restart.json and restarted the
      box. Run once, at 3:36 PM box time on 16 Sep 2026, and never since. The
      same folder holds dev-instance.ps1, an older copy of
      vps-dev-instance.ps1 that nothing runs, and update.log.
    Thornswood Dev Crash Capture
      powershell.exe -File C:\Thornswood-Diagnostics\Capture-DevCrash.ps1. It
      hung ProcDump on the dev server's node for one access violation dump.
      Run by hand on 30 Sep and 2 Oct for the Whiterun crash; the dev server
      exited on 3 Oct with no dump taken. The folder holds ProcDump, the pdbs
      of three old engine builds and a copy of the dev server-settings.json
      from 1 Oct.

  WHY NOTHING NEEDS THEM.
    Windows Update is vps-harden.ps1's: the update policy it sets downloads,
    installs at 4 AM box time and restarts on a 15 minute timer, and Windows
    has installed by it since (25 Oct the last). A second way in, which
    installs whatever it finds whenever it is started, as SYSTEM, from a
    script no pull request can change, is not wanted. When updates run is
    #3213's, in vps-harden.ps1.
    Crash dumps are Windows Error Reporting's: LocalDumps writes node.exe's
    dumps into C:\Thornswood-Dumps for both servers, as Lock-VpsFolders.ps1
    keeps it, with nothing hung on a process (#1267). An engine build's pdb
    comes from the fork's build artifact.

  WHAT IT DOES, for each task and its folder in turn:
    refuses the task when it is not as it was read: its action is not the one
    above, it has a trigger, or it is running. Somebody has started using it
    then, and it is said and left as it is, with its folder.
    refuses the folder when it is a link or holds one anywhere inside it
    (removing through a link reaches what it points at), when a running
    process or another task names it, or when it holds a crash dump (*.dmp),
    which somebody reads first. The task still goes; the folder stays.
    removes the task, then the folder, and reads both back.
  A task or folder that is not there any more is said and skipped, so a
  second run changes nothing. -WhatIf says what it would remove and removes
  nothing. Exits 1 when anything was refused or did not go.

  REFUSES, besides: anywhere that is not the box (BoxGuard.ps1), and an
  account that is not an elevated Administrator.

  tests\test-3288-hand-made-tasks.ps1 runs it against stand-ins.
