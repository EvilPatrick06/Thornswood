  Clear-OldWorldCopies.ps1

  Removes the copies of the world that every server install before #446 left
  in the VPS temp folder, keeping the newest of each kind (issue #1074). Runs
  ON the VPS, as Administrator, through Remote.ps1.

      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Clear-OldWorldCopies.ps1 -Arguments '-WhatIf'
      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Clear-OldWorldCopies.ps1

  WHY. Until 28 September Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 copied the world, the
  data folder and the roster into %TEMP% on every install, as world-<stamp>,
  serverdata-<stamp> and serverprivate-<stamp>, moved the logs to
  serverlogs-<stamp>, and never deleted any of them. Publish-Server runs it
  over ssh as Administrator, so every live and dev publish since then left a
  whole world in Administrator's temp folder. serverprivate-* holds a copy of
  door.json and its key each time. The installer stopped making them with #446.

  WHAT IT DOES. Looks in Administrator's temp folder and in C:\Windows\Temp
  (in case one ran as SYSTEM), for folders named exactly
  world-, serverdata-, serverprivate- or serverlogs- and a yyyyMMdd-HHmmss
  stamp, directly in those folders and nowhere below. Says how many there are
  and how much each kind holds, keeps the newest of each kind, and removes the
  rest. -IncludeNewest removes the newest ones too, but only once a nightly
  backup newer than each has been made (C:\Thornswood-Backup), so the last copy
  of anything goes only after a backup holds it.

  WHAT IT REFUSES.
    - anywhere that is not the box: a Windows workstation, which a gaming PC
      is, or a machine Windows will not say is a server (BoxGuard.ps1)
    - a folder that is a link or holds one anywhere inside it: it is left as
      it is and said, because removing through a link can reach whatever the
      link points at
    - anything not named as above
  -WhatIf lists and adds up, and removes nothing.

  tests\test-clear-world-copies.ps1 runs it against scratch folders.
