  Restore-Box.ps1

  Puts a nightly backup back onto a new VPS, run from this machine.

  All of it in one command: both game servers' worlds, the site, the bot and
  Caddy's file (issue #454). docs\MOVING-THE-SERVER.md says when in a move to
  run it, and docs\RESTORING.md "The box is gone" when there is nothing left
  to move from.

      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Box.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc -Check    ready? sends nothing
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Box.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Box.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc -Expect 1234567

  The box has no repository, so this carries what it needs across and takes
  it away again:

    1. Here: Restore-Backup.ps1 -CheckOnly, with this machine's passphrase
       (Documents\thornswood-backup-key.txt). A backup that does not open,
       or holds no characters, stops it before anything is sent.
    2. On the box, asked, not changed: the live and dev server folders hold
       the server program (Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1, vps-dev-instance.ps1)
       and nothing that writes what this puts back is running (the watchdog,
       both game servers, the site, the bot). -Check stops here.
    3. Sends the backup, the passphrase file and three scripts into
       C:\Thornswood-Restore: Restore-Backup.ps1, Restore-Server.ps1 and
       vps-restore-services.ps1. The passphrase also goes to
       C:\Thornswood-Backup\key.txt when the box has none there, so the
       nightly backups the new box takes open with the same file as every
       one before them.
    4. Restore-Server.ps1 into C:\Thornswood-Server, then -Which dev into
       C:\Thornswood-Server-Dev (-NoDev leaves dev out).
    5. Restore-Backup.ps1 unpacks it there, and vps-restore-services.ps1 puts
       the site's data, config, uploads and feed store, the bot's settings and
       join record and the Caddyfile back.
    6. Delete-Person.ps1 -Reapply removes again everybody who asked to be
       deleted (#2351): the people in the box's own record of completed
       requests, C:\Thornswood-Deletions\requests.jsonl, and in the one the
       backup carries, merged into it first. A backup holds the people who
       asked after it was taken; nothing may start before they are gone.
    7. Deletes C:\Thornswood-Restore, whatever happened above: it holds the
       bot token and the site keys.

  Starts nothing. Deploy-Docs.ps1, Install-Bot.ps1 -NoToken and starting the
  game servers come after it, in the order MOVING-THE-SERVER.md gives.

  Prints RESTORE BOX OK and exits 0 only when all three restores and the
  reapply said OK.
  Nothing secret is printed or put on a command line: the passphrase goes
  across as a file, and what the box says back is what the three scripts
  print, which never includes a value out of a config.
