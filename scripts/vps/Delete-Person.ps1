  Delete-Person.ps1

  Carries out a deletion request (issue #2351). Finds one person's records in
  every store on the box by their Discord id, shows how many there are, and
  when told to, removes them from every copy nothing runs from and asks each
  service that holds some to take the rest out of its own files as it next
  starts, stopping nothing (#2758). Writes the request down so that a restore
  reapplies it. Runs ON the VPS, as Administrator, sent there by Remote.ps1:

      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Delete-Person.ps1 -Arguments '-DiscordId 123456789012345678'
      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Delete-Person.ps1 -Arguments '-DiscordId 123456789012345678 -Delete -By Patrick'
      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Delete-Person.ps1 -Arguments '-Reapply'
      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\Delete-Person.ps1 -Arguments '-Reapply -Delete'

  WHY. site\data\site\privacy.md promises that somebody who asks in the
  Discord has their Discord link, session records, chat and character
  deleted, by a person, and that staff reapply completed requests before an
  older backup goes back into service. Until this there was no list of where a
  person's records are, no way to remove them but by hand, and no record of
  what had been done. Patrick decided on 12 October 2026 (option A on #2351): a
  staff script that finds, shows counts, deletes with a dry run first, and
  records each request so a restore reapplies it. "Deletion requests" in
  docs\WEBSITE-OPERATIONS.md is the procedure around it.

  A DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. Without -Delete nothing is changed or written.
  It prints, for every store, how many of the person's records are there and
  whether a real run removes them or leaves them, and which services still
  have a request for them that they take at their next start ("waiting"), so
  it is also how staff see when a request is done. Counts only, never what a
  record says and never an address.

  WHO. Their Discord id, and their characters: the profile ids linked.json
  holds for them, which the site checked were theirs when they played, and on
  a reapply also the ids the record wrote down. A profile id that another
  account also holds is not theirs to delete and is left, and said.

  WHAT A REAL RUN REMOVES, the person's own records, in every copy on the box
  (the live folder and the copies a restore, a wipe, an install or a character
  reset sets aside beside it). The copies go at once. The live folders are
  each service's own, and it takes them at its next start (below):
    site            their Discord link (linked.json), their answer to the
                    rules (rules-accepted.json), their sign-in rows
                    (signins.json, which hold an address), their session rows
                    (sessions.json) with the launcher logs sent with them
                    (session-logs) and the failed-session alerts about them
                    (for-bot\trouble.json), their characters' rows in
                    roster.json, the tickets, applications and calls for help
                    they sent (for-bot\inbox.json), and their gallery
                    pictures, waiting or approved, with the file
    game servers    each character's change form (world\changeForms, and the
                    world-before-* and _discarded-* copies), its card
                    (private\characters.json and the characters-before-*
                    copies), its mod menu choices (private\mod-settings.json),
                    its take counts (private\take-limit.json) and when it last
                    left (private\last-left.json, and data\last-left.json in a
                    folder set aside before #2582 moved it), live and dev
    voice           every chat line their characters wrote, out of each day's
                    file, live and dev, except the lines said inside a
                    session staff marked kept (#2166), which stay with it.
                    The voice service itself never edits a day
                    (voice\voice-server.js); server-log.js does, before
                    voice starts, and the record keeps each day's line count
                    when the request was made
    the bot         their join number (joins.json; the last number given out
                    stays, so nobody is handed theirs again) and their open
                    ticket (open-tickets.json)

  WHAT IT LEAVES, counted and said:
    - staff's records about them: bans, PKs and notes (bans.json, pk.json,
      notes.json), the staff logs' lines naming them (moderation.log on the
      site and on each game server, the game server's door.log), reports they
      made and reports made about them (inbox.json, gallery-reports.json), and
      a session staff marked kept, with its launcher logs, alerts, the copy
      of its chat and the chat lines in the day files inside its window. The
      privacy page: "What cannot be undone is something you said that
      somebody else has already quoted in a report, because that now belongs
      to the report." Each of these still goes when its keeping time on the
      privacy page is up, by the code that writes it (#2353).
    - the game's registers that it does not let go (below): the old copies a
      game server kept in data, and the merchant ledger, whose release is the
      merchant code's to write (#2351): counted, never changed.
    - a gallery picture with an open report against it, or taken down after
      one and still held, which is staff's while they look into it (#2352);
      and one approved before the site kept the sending account in its
      uploads note (16 Oct 2026, #2351), which nothing ties to them, so staff
      remove theirs in the hub by name.
    - logs, which age by their own rule (server.log 30 days, #2349; the
      site's, the gamemode's, voice's and the bot's 90 days, #2166), and the
      encrypted backups, which expire on their schedule and are why the
      record exists.

  WHAT THE GAME SERVER LETS GO AT ITS NEXT START (Patrick, 16 October, option
  A on #2351: "Delete-Person.ps1 writes a list, and the gamemode releases
  those entries at its next start"). The game's registers in a server's
  private folder name a character: a house and its master key in
  property.json, with the notice boards' posts and the drop box and its
  record; a farm in farm-claims.json; an office in law.json; a bed's guests
  and takings in beds.json; the embassy and remnant rolls in embassy.json; a
  dungeon chest's reservation in dungeon-rewards-ledger.json; a faction or
  business book's members, chat and owner in books.json. This script never
  edits those: what happens to a house or a post held by somebody who is gone
  is each register's own rule, and that rule is in the gamemode. So it counts
  them ("release" in what it prints) and, for every server that holds
  something of theirs, writes private\deleted-characters.json beside them:
  their profile ids and the form ids of the characters it found there. The
  game server's release block reads it at its start, lets go of every entry
  through the register's own code, logs counts only and deletes the list. A
  faction or business book they own is disbanded then, so the procedure says
  to have staff hand it on in the game first when the group wants to keep it.

  A REAL RUN STOPS NOTHING (#2758). Patrick, 18 Oct 2026, after the first
  real run, on his own account: "it should not restart everytime we want to
  delete a person it should just fully apply the rest upon a server restart".
  The site, a game server, a voice service and the bot each write their files
  while they run, so a file changed underneath one would be written straight
  back over. So this never changes a live service's files. It writes the
  request into the folder of each service that holds something of theirs,
  merged into one still waiting there, and the service takes it out of its own
  files as it next starts, before anything of theirs is open:
    site           data\deletion-requests.json, taken by site\server.js
                   before it listens
    a game server  private\deleted-characters.json: server-log.js, which its
                   task starts it under, deletes their change forms and takes
                   them out of the card, mod menu, take count and last-left
                   files before the engine starts (scripts\vps\Server-Log.js);
                   then the gamemode lets go of the registers (above)
    voice          deletion-requests.json in its folder, with the windows of
                   the sessions staff kept: server-log.js, before voice starts
    the bot        deletion-requests.json in its data folder, taken by
                   bot\bot.py before it connects
  Each says it in its own log with counts, and deletes the request once every
  part took; a part that did not take waits for the next start. Nothing
  restarts on a schedule: a service starts again at a deploy or an install of
  its own, after a crash and after a reboot, which in October 2026 was about
  a day for the game servers and the site and up to a week for voice and the
  bot (#2758 has the count). Until it does, its copy still holds the records;
  the procedure (docs\WEBSITE-OPERATIONS.md) says when the person is told.
  A copy set aside with an unfinished save (.pending-batch in changeForms)
  is refused: the engine would replay it if that copy were put back, and
  could write a deleted character back. Every file is read and checked
  before any is written, and each JSON file is written to a file beside it
  and swapped in, the way the site writes its own.

  THE RECORD. Each request is one line in
  C:\Thornswood-Deletions\requests.jsonl, written when it is made: the
  Discord id, the profile ids, when, who ran it, the counts it removes and
  the services it asked. Nothing else about the person.
  The folder is SYSTEM's and Administrators' only, locked when this makes it,
  with read for the nightly backup's task (-BackupTask). The nightly backup
  takes it (deletions\requests.jsonl), so it leaves the box with every
  backup. Until #2833 the lock gave the backup no read, and the night
  after the first deletion the backup could not read the record.

  -Reapply reads that record and asks for every request in it again, the same
  way: after a backup is put back and before anything starts, so each service
  takes them at the start that puts it back in service (Restore-Box.ps1 runs
  it, and docs\RESTORING.md says when by hand). -Merge names other copies of
  the record (the one in the backup being put back, or one from a newer
  backup); lines the box's record does not have are added to it first.
  -Reapply never adds a line of its own.

  WHAT IT REFUSES, with nothing changed:
    - anywhere with C:\Thornswood\Game\SkyrimSE.exe, which is a gaming PC
    - a Discord id that is not 17 to 20 digits
    - -Delete without -By, the person running it
    - a JSON file, or a line of the record, that is there and will not parse
    - no node on the PATH (the JSON is edited by node, as the site writes it)

  tests\test-2351-delete-person.ps1 runs it against stand-ins of every store.

.PARAMETER DiscordId
  The Discord id of the person who asked, 17 to 20 digits.

  Change things. Without it this is a dry run that changes nothing.
.PARAMETER By
  Who is running the request, written into the record. Required with -Delete.
.PARAMETER Reapply
  Remove every request in the record again, after a restore.
.PARAMETER Merge
  With -Reapply: other copies of the record to add to the box's first.
.PARAMETER SiteRoot
  The site's folder.
.PARAMETER GameRoot
  The live game server's folder.
.PARAMETER DevGameRoot
  The dev game server's folder.
.PARAMETER VoiceRoot
  The live voice service's folder.
.PARAMETER DevVoiceRoot
  The dev voice service's folder.
.PARAMETER BotRoot
  The bot's folder.
.PARAMETER RecordRoot
  Where the record of completed requests is kept.
.PARAMETER BackupTask
  The nightly backup's scheduled task (Install-Backup.ps1 -TaskName), whose
  own SID is given read on the record's folder. Nothing is given when no
  task of that name is registered; Install-Backup.ps1 gives it read then.
.PARAMETER AllowGamingPc
  Run on a machine with the game on it. Only the tests pass it.

        The game's registers (#2351, Patrick's A of 16 October): the ones the
        gamemode keeps in private are let go by the game server itself, at
        its next start, through each register's own rule, from the list this
        writes beside them (private\deleted-characters.json, the release
        block in game\gamemode.js). So here they are counted, never edited.
        A server that holds something of theirs gets the list: their profile
        ids and the form ids of their characters found here, merged into a
        list still waiting there, with what was already done cleared so every
        part runs for the new ids too. Nothing is stopped for it (#2758): the
        list is the request, and at the server's next start server-log.js
        takes out their saves (the part "saves") and the gamemode lets go of
        the registers. A copy set aside gets one too when it holds a register
        of theirs, which nothing runs from until it is put back; its saves go
        now. Every other file is counted and left: the old copies in data,
        and the merchant ledger, whose release is the merchant code's to
        write (#2351).
