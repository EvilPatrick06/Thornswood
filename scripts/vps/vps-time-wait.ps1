.SYNOPSIS
  Runs ON the VPS, sent there by Set-TimeWait.ps1: holds a connection the box
  closed in TIME_WAIT for 30 seconds instead of Windows' 120, and restarts the
  box for it when asked and nobody is on either server.

.DESCRIPTION
  Issue #2946, Patrick's A on q-2946-time-wait (21 Oct 2026).

  Measured with pktmon on 21 Oct, 03:58Z to 04:13Z. The box closes every
  HTTPS connection from the cloud first, because the cloud's proxy passes the
  client's TLS close_notify at once and its FIN about 10 s later. So Windows
  keeps each one's address and port in TIME_WAIT for 120 s, the default with
  no TcpTimedWaitDelay. The cloud leaves through a NAT that gives the same
  address and port to a new connection 35 to 117 s later. Windows drops that
  new SYN silently whenever its sequence number is below the old
  connection's, which is about half the time: 39 of the 40 SYNs the box
  never answered were that. Of 268 reuses measured, none came sooner than
  35 s. At 30 s the box has let go of the pair before the NAT hands it out
  again.

  TcpTimedWaitDelay is a DWORD under
  HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters. Windows takes 30
  to 300 and reads it only when it starts, so the value does nothing until
  the box restarts.

  Every line it prints starts with a word: NOW, ALREADY, CHANGED, WOULD,
  ROOM, NOTE, RESTARTING or STOP. It deletes itself before it ends, and
  before the restart when there is one.

.PARAMETER Check
  Only say what the value is now. Nothing is changed.

.PARAMETER Restart
  After the value is right, restart the box so Windows reads it. This
  refuses while anybody is on the live or the dev server, or while either
  one's count cannot be read. The servers, voice, the site, the bot, Caddy
  and the bridge all start again with the box (each is a startup task).

.PARAMETER DryRun
  Read everything and say WOULD for each change. Nothing is changed and
  nothing restarts.

.PARAMETER Layer
  A file that replaces the functions below that touch Windows, and may set
  $ServerRoots. Only tests\test-time-wait.ps1 passes it.
