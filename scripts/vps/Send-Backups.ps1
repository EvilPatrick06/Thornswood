  Send-Backups.ps1

  Sends each night's encrypted backup off the box to the Oracle VM, where it
  goes on to Google Drive (Patrick, 31 Oct 2026, #2862). It replaces One's
  Fetch-Backups.ps1: the copy off the box no longer waits for One to be on.

      Send-Backups.ps1 -Install -VmHost <address>   make the key, read the VM's host key, register the task
      Send-Backups.ps1                              send what has not gone yet (the task runs this)
      Send-Backups.ps1 -Status                      what is set up and what was sent

  WHERE IT GOES. The VM takes it as tw-boxdrop over SFTP into a jail where it
  can add a file and do nothing else: no list, read, rename, overwrite or
  delete, and its key works only from this box's address (Thornswood-Hermes,
  deploy/sshd/51-tw-boxdrop.conf). So a stolen box cannot reach a copy it
  already sent, on the VM or on Drive. After each file it sends <name>.done
  holding "<sha256> <size>", which the VM checks before it takes the file.

  WHAT GOES. Only thornswood-<date>-<time>.zip.enc, encrypted with the
  passphrase, which never leaves this box, from the last seven days and not
  sent before (sent.txt beside it). Each one is opened first with
  Restore-Backup.ps1 -CheckOnly, so only a backup that opens is sent; one
  that does not is named and the run fails.

  WHEN. The task "Thornswood Send Backups" starts when the nightly backup's
  task ends (the Task Scheduler's own "task completed" event for
  \Thornswood Backup), so it sends tonight's straight after it is made, with
  no clock between them.

  WHAT STAFF SEE. After each file the VM took, its name goes into
  C:\Thornswood-Watch\offbox.txt, which the watchdog's "copy of the backups
  off the VPS" check reads: older than 26 hours and staff are told, as when
  One fetched them.

  Runs as SYSTEM from its own copy in C:\Thornswood-Backup\offbox, which only
  SYSTEM and Administrators may open (the backup folder's own lock). Windows
  PowerShell 5.1.
