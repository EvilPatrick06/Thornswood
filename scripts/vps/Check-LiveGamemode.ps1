.SYNOPSIS
  Says whether the gamemode running on the VPS is the one in this repo.

.DESCRIPTION
  Read only. It hashes game\gamemode.js here, hashes C:\Thornswood-Server\gamemode.js
  up there, and compares them, and the same for the tables the gamemode
  reads as it loads (#5191), game\gamemode-tables here and gamemode-tables
  beside it there, by their git tree id. Nothing is copied and nothing is
  restarted.

  It exists because this question came up three times on 20 September and was
  guessed at each time. Ship.ps1 does not carry gamemode.js: grep it and the
  word does not appear. The gamemode only travels by Deploy-Gamemode.ps1, which
  copies it into the server build on this machine, and then Deploy-Server.ps1,
  which is what actually sends it up. So a release can go out, twice, with the
  gamemode fix still sitting on the shipping machine and nothing saying so.

  On that day the fix for characters meeting creation a second time was
  committed, built into the local server dist, and not up there, while 1.1.58
  and 1.1.59 both shipped. Testers kept reporting it.

.PARAMETER Vps
  The server. Defaults to the live one.

.EXAMPLE
  .\Check-LiveGamemode.ps1
  Prints a match or a mismatch, and names what to run if they differ.
