  vps-runner-logs.ps1

  Runs ON the VPS, once a day, as the scheduled task that
  Keep-RunnerLogs.ps1 -Install puts there (C:\Thornswood-Watch\runner-logs.ps1).
  Not meant to be run from this machine, except by
  tests\test-3184-runner-logs.ps1, which runs it against scratch folders.

  WHY THIS EXISTS (#3184). actions/runner writes a Runner_*.log every time a
  runner starts and a Worker_*.log for every job into its _diag folder, and
  per-step logs into _diag\pages, and never removes any of them. On 21 Oct 2026
  the box's runners held about 4,000 of them, 1.6 GB, the oldest from 25 Sep,
  and 255 jobs a day add more. A job's own log is on GitHub for 90 days; these
  are the runner's side of it, read only when a job went wrong on the box, so
  two weeks of them is plenty.

  WHAT IT DOES. In _diag and _diag\pages of every runner folder under -Root
  named Thornswood-Runner or Thornswood-RunnerN, removes the files named
  Runner_*.log, Worker_*.log and, in pages, *.log, last written more than -Days
  days ago. Nothing else, and nothing below those two folders. A file it
  cannot remove (a runner that is writing it) is said in the log with what
  Windows answered, and left for the next day.

  Each run appends a line or two to runner-logs.log beside it: how many it
  removed and how much that was, and each one it could not. Keep it ASCII:
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs it.
