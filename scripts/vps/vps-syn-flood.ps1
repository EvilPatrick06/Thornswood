  vps-syn-flood.ps1

  Measures the forged SYN flood on the box's port 443 (#2995) and what it
  costs the box, over a short window. Runs ON the box, in Windows PowerShell,
  sent by Remote.ps1 from a clean main checkout:

      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\vps-syn-flood.ps1
      .\scripts\vps\Remote.ps1 -File .\scripts\vps\vps-syn-flood.ps1 -Arguments '-Seconds 120'

  WHAT THE FLOOD IS. Somebody sends SYNs to 443 with the source address of
  somebody else (residential ranges, mostly Russian, changing all the time),
  so the box's SYN-ACKs, and its four resends of each, go to the forged
  address: the box is one reflector of many in an attack on those addresses.
  Measured on 21 Oct 2026 (#2995): about 110 to 120 half-open connections on
  443 at any moment, 5 to 8 failed connects a second, four or five SYN-ACKs
  and one RST sent for each forged SYN, and 83% of the SYNs in the #2946
  capture with no TCP option at all, which no real client sends. It costs the box next to
  nothing (Caddy never sees a half-open connection; the SYN-ACKs are a few
  kilobytes a second), but it makes the box's retransmit share read near 20%,
  which is the flood and not a fault in the network. The fix is the host's:
  filtering forged SYNs upstream before they reach the box.

  WHY A SCRIPT. So the same measurement can be taken again, by anybody, the
  day the host says it filters, and the numbers compared with the ones above.
  Lines typed into a shell on the live box from a cloud session are refused
  (#2970); a reviewed file sent by Remote.ps1 is not.

  WHAT IT READS, and it changes nothing:
    the process that listens on 443;
    the half-open (SynReceived) connections on 443, every 10 seconds;
    the TCPv4 raw counters (passive opens, failed connects, segments sent and
    retransmitted) at the start and the end of the window;
    the 443 process's CPU time and working set.
  No address is printed: only how many, and how many distinct /16s.

  WHAT IT PRINTS:
      LISTENER <process> pid <n>
      HALF-OPEN 443 min <n> avg <n> max <n>, <n> addresses in <n> /16s
      CONNECTS <n> passive, <n> failed (<p>%) in <s> s
      RETRANSMITS <n>/s of <n>/s sent (<p>%), about <n> per failed connect
      COST <process> <p>% of one core, <n> MB; SYN-ACKs about <n> bytes/s out
      VERDICT FLOOD|QUIET <why>
  FLOOD is 20 or more half-open on 443 on average; a box nobody floods has a
  handful at most. Exit 0 either way; 1 only when it could not measure.

  tests\test-syn-flood.ps1 holds it to this.
