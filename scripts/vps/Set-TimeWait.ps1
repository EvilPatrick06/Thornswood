.SYNOPSIS
  Sets TcpTimedWaitDelay to 30 seconds on the VPS, so the box stops dropping
  connections from the cloud before TLS (#2946), and restarts the box for it
  when asked and nobody is on either server.

.DESCRIPTION
  Issue #2946, Patrick's A on q-2946-time-wait (21 Oct 2026). The cause, as
  measured with pktmon on 21 Oct: the box closes each cloud HTTPS connection
  first, so Windows keeps its address and port in TIME_WAIT for 120 s; the
  cloud's NAT gives the same address and port to a new connection 35 to 117 s
  later; and Windows silently drops that new SYN whenever its sequence number
  is below the old connection's. At 30 s the box has let go of the pair
  before the NAT hands it out again. scripts\vps\vps-time-wait.ps1 says more.

  Runs on your machine. In this order, and it stops at the first thing that
  is not right:

    1. The box's own key. known_hosts here must hold the host key
       scripts\vps\vps.json pins.
    2. Key login, and when the box last started.
    3. On the box: scripts\vps\vps-time-wait.ps1 is copied to C:\Windows\Temp
       and run there (it deletes itself). It sets the value and reads it
       back. With -Restart it then reads who is on the live and the dev
       server, refuses while anybody is or while a count cannot be read, and
       restarts the box.
    4. With -Restart: waits for the box to answer again with a later start
       time, then reads the value as Windows now holds it.
    5. With -Restart: the Thornswood startup tasks, the bot and the ports, as
       the box has them after it started.

  -Check only reads the value. -WhatIf does steps 1 and 2 and runs step 3
  read only: it prints what WOULD change, and that it would restart.

  Windows reads the value only when it starts, so without -Restart it is set
  and does nothing yet.

  A restart stops everything on the box for a few minutes: both servers,
  voice, the site and the feed, the bot, the bridge, and every build on the
  box's runners. Each comes back by itself as a startup task or service.

.PARAMETER Check
  Only say what the value is now. Nothing is changed.

.PARAMETER Restart
  Restart the box once the value is set, so Windows reads it.

.PARAMETER Vps
  The box's address. vps.json's by default.

.PARAMETER User
  The account the scripts log in as. vps.json's by default (Administrator).

.PARAMETER KnownHosts
  The known_hosts file that must already hold the pinned key.

.PARAMETER BackMinutes
  How long to wait for the box to answer again after the restart. 15 by
  default.

.PARAMETER PollSeconds
  How often to ask whether it has. 15 by default.

.PARAMETER NoPause
  Do not wait for Enter before closing.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\vps\Set-TimeWait.ps1 -Check
  Says what TcpTimedWaitDelay is on the box. Changes nothing.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\vps\Set-TimeWait.ps1 -Restart -WhatIf
  Says what it would change, who is on, and that it would restart.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\vps\Set-TimeWait.ps1 -Restart
  Sets the value, restarts the box when nobody is on, and reads it back after.
