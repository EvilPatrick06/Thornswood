  Set-Vps.ps1

  Renames the game's own name, the one name everything reaches the box by.

      .\scripts\vps\Set-Vps.ps1

  It asks for the new name, shows you what it is about to change, and waits
  for a yes before touching anything.

  Why this exists: the name lives in scripts\vps\vps.json, and the admin
  scripts read it through Vps.ps1. The same name is written into the few
  files that cannot read vps.json at run time: the launcher source, the
  whose-game plugin, the example config and the docs. This script walks the
  repo (vps.json included) so one rename stays one rename.

  A BOX MOVE IS NOT THIS (#3690). The repository names the box only by its
  name, a DNS record in Cloudflare, and never by its address, because the
  repository is going public. A new box is that record pointed at its
  address (docs\MOVING-THE-SERVER.md), and no file changes. So this refuses
  an IP address. Launchers already installed take a new name from the feed
  (Set-Server.ps1), so nothing is written into the launcher to move them.

  What it does NOT do, because Set-Server.ps1 already does it properly:
  config.json on this machine, and version.json for everyone else's launcher.
  Run that one after this one. It is printed at the end.

  Reads and rewrites files in the repo only. Nothing is sent anywhere.
