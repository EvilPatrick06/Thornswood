.SYNOPSIS
  Runs ON THE VPS, sent there by Set-WebFirewall.ps1: lets TCP 80 and 443 in
  only from Cloudflare's ranges, so a forged SYN from anywhere else gets no
  answer (#2995). -Open puts both back to any address.

.DESCRIPTION
  Do not run this by hand. Set-WebFirewall.ps1 sends this file's text on
  ssh's standard input with the ranges from scripts\deploy\cloudflare-ranges.txt,
  and Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs it from there, so nothing of it is ever
  written on the box (#3035).

  WHY. Issue #2995, Patrick's A on q-2995-syn-fix (21 Oct 2026). The box
  answered every SYN on 443 from anybody, so forged SYNs carrying other
  people's addresses made it send each of them four or five SYN-ACKs: it was
  one reflector of many in an attack on those addresses (measured on 21 Oct:
  up to 15 a second, 83% of them with no TCP option at all, 189 half-open at
  once). BisectHosting declined to filter them upstream. With thornswood.net
  behind Cloudflare's proxy every real visitor reaches the box from a
  Cloudflare address, so the box drops everything else on 80 and 443 without
  an answer, the way the firewall already drops every port nothing allows.

  In this order, each step saying what it found:

    the list      every entry an address and a prefix length. Anything else
                  stops it, and so does an empty list with -Apply.
    the rules     "Thornswood Web 80" and "Thornswood Web 443", which
                  Setup-Domain.ps1 makes; either missing stops it. Then
                  every other enabled inbound Allow rule that lets TCP 80 or
                  443 in from any address for Caddy (any program or
                  caddy.exe, no app container, any service). With -Apply
                  one of those stops it, since it would still answer the
                  flood. A rule bound to a Store app's package or to another
                  program never lets Caddy's traffic in, so it does not count.
    the profiles  every firewall profile on, and none letting everything in.
                  With -Apply one off stops it: the scope would mean nothing.
    the name      thornswood.net and www as Google's and Cloudflare's public
                  resolvers give them, which is what a visitor gets. With
                  -Apply an answer outside the ranges stops it: the name
                  still points straight at the box for somebody, and the
                  scope would shut them out. That is also why -Apply waits
                  out the record's five minutes after the proxy goes on.
    the change    each rule's remote address becomes the list, and is read
                  back. -Open makes it Any. A connection already open stays
                  open, and port 22 and the bridge are never touched.

  Every line of output starts with one word: RULE, ALSO, PROFILE, NAME,
  CHANGED, WOULD (with -DryRun), ALREADY, STOP or DONE. STOP means nothing
  after it was done, and the exit code is 1.

.PARAMETER Check
  Read all of it and change nothing.

.PARAMETER Apply
  Set both rules to -Ranges.

.PARAMETER Open
  Set both rules back to any address.

.PARAMETER Ranges
  Cloudflare's ranges, comma separated, as cloudflare-ranges.txt lists them.

.PARAMETER Domain
  The site's name. thornswood.net by default.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  With -Apply or -Open: read everything and say WOULD for each change.

.PARAMETER Layer
  A file that replaces the functions below that touch Windows (the firewall
  and DNS). Only tests\test-2995-cloudflare-front.ps1 passes it.
