  GateRules.ps1

  What the deploy gate (#2841) will run, as functions with no side effects,
  so the box's broker, the client and tests\test-2841-deploy-gate.ps1 all
  hold a line to the same rules. Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.

  A LINE is what the restricted deploy key asks for, the way it would be
  typed after the script's name:

      Deploy-DevGamemode -Restart -Why "a gamemode update"
      Get-Logs -Dev -Lines 2000
      ping

  It is words split on spaces, and a value with spaces in double quotes.
  Nothing in it is ever run by a shell or read as PowerShell: the broker
  matches the verb to verbs.json, every parameter to that verb's rule, and
  starts the verb's script with the words it built itself. So a line that
  holds a character a shell or PowerShell would read (a dollar sign, a
  backslash, a backtick, a quote inside a value, a semicolon outside a text
  value) is refused whole, before anything runs.
