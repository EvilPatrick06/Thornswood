  Request-Restart.ps1

  Tells the live server to warn everybody and then clear them out, without
  needing to be standing in the world to type /restart.

  Drops a small json file into the server's data folder over ssh. The gamemode
  checks for it every tick and a half, acts on it, and deletes it, so a file
  left behind by a crash cannot fire again on the next boot.

    .\Request-Restart.ps1                     5 minutes, an update
    .\Request-Restart.ps1 -Minutes 10
    .\Request-Restart.ps1 -Mode restart -Why "a server rebuild"
    .\Request-Restart.ps1 -Cancel
    .\Request-Restart.ps1 -Mode restart -ThenRestart

  Only -Mode restart disconnects people, and it has to say which half is
  coming, and is refused outright without one of them. A kick with nothing
  restarting behind it leaves everybody who reconnects in an empty world with
  no NPCs, and they stay that way until the process is bounced, so the two are
  not separable.

    -ThenRestart     this script waits out the countdown and bounces it
    -RestartFollows  you are going to, or your caller is. Deploy-Server
                     passes this, because it stops and starts the task itself

  -Mode notice and -Mode update need neither, because they disconnect nobody:
  an update is a word in chat, and the launcher closes the game itself when
  it sees the pack. Ship.ps1 sends update.

  Mode decides the wording and whether anybody is put out.

    notice   the server is about to blink. A freeze of a few seconds, then
             everything carries on. Nobody is disconnected. This is what a
             server build push actually is.
    update   a pack has been published, so everyone has to quit to the
             launcher to pick it up. Ends with a kick.
    restart  the server itself is going down for longer. Ends with a kick.
