  Seal.ps1

  How a secret held by GitHub reaches the box without passing through any
  session, chat or log in a form anybody can read (#3216, Patrick's A of
  22 Oct 2026). Dot-source it beside Vps.ps1:

      . (Join-Path $Here '..\vps\Seal.ps1')

  WHY. Patrick pastes a secret once, into the repository's Actions secrets,
  which is a page only he signs in to. A workflow can read it there, but a
  workflow's log is open to everybody on the repository, and the Desk that
  must put the value on the box is a Claude session whose every word is kept.
  The Desk refused to read the Turnstile secret through the Cloudflare
  connector for that reason. So the value is sealed: the workflow encrypts it
  to a key whose private half never leaves the box, and only the sealed form
  goes through GitHub and the session. Only the box can open it.

  THE KEY. RSA 3072, made on the box the first time it is asked for (the
  block from Get-ThornswoodSealKeyBlock), kept as one file in C:\Thornswood-Seal
  that only SYSTEM, Administrators and the account that made it can read. The
  public half is printed for the caller to hand to the workflow; it is
  public, so it may go anywhere. The private half is never printed, copied or
  sent.

  THE SEAL. RSA-OAEP with SHA-1 (RSAEncryptionPadding.OaepSHA1), through
  [Security.Cryptography.RSA]::Create(), which every PowerShell here has:
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 on the box and PowerShell 7 on a runner or
  anywhere. The key object is never a named key container, so nothing is
  left in a Windows key store. A 3072-bit key seals
  up to 342 bytes, far more than a token. The sealed value is base64, one line.

  tests\test-3216-turnstile-seal.ps1 seals and opens with these blocks.
