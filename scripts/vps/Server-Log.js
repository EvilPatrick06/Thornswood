  Server-Log.js

  Writes the game server's log, server.log, and keeps nothing in it, or in any
  rolled copy of it, for longer than 30 days. It goes up beside the server as
  server-log.js, and the server's scheduled task runs the server under it:

      cmd /c "start "" /b /wait /high node server-log.js --log <root>\server.log --also thornswood.log dist_back/skymp5-server.js & call exit %^errorlevel%"

      node server-log.js --log <root>\server.log --roll     rolls it now and applies the 30 days, then exits (an install)

  And since #2166 two other logs that name people, which used to roll by
  size only, with nothing aging them:

      --also thornswood.log      the gamemode's own log, beside server.log, kept
                                 to 90 days (--also-days). The gamemode writes
                                 and rolls it by size (game/gamemode.js); this
                                 moves it aside once its first line is from an
                                 earlier day, and cuts every rolled copy of it
                                 (its .1 to .5 and the dated ones) to 90 days,
                                 at a start, at a roll and once an hour, the same
                                 way as server.log's own. Nothing in game\ changes.
      --days 90 --stamp          the voice service runs under this too
                                 (Install-Voice.ps1, vps-dev-instance.ps1), so
                                 voice.log is rolled at midnight and at 4 MB and
                                 kept to 90 days rather than held open by cmd's
                                 >> and rolled only at a start. Voice's lines carry
                                 no time of their own, so --stamp puts this
                                 process's in front of each one, which is what
                                 lets a line be aged at all.

  WHY (#2349). The engine writes the address of every connection into its
  console ("Connecting a user N with ip ...", skymp5-server ts/systems/login.ts),
  beside the line that names the slot's Discord id. Until 12 Oct 2026 that
  console went to server.log through cmd's >> server.log 2>&1, and cmd holds
  that file open for as long as the server runs, so the only roll it could
  have was Roll-Log.ps1 in front of each start, by size, five kept. Nothing
  aged it: a server that was not restarted kept one file growing, and the
  five rolled ones held whatever they held, however old. Measured 12 Oct: the
  oldest connecting address on disk was from 21 Sep on live and 4 Oct on dev,
  while the privacy page said the 30-day sign-in log was the only thing
  holding an address. Decided by Patrick on 12 Oct (#2349, B and C): the
  server log is deleted after 30 days, and the privacy page says it holds the
  address for that long.

  HOW. This process starts the server as its child with both streams piped to
  it, and is the only thing that holds server.log. So it can roll the file
  whenever it needs to, which cmd's redirect never allowed:

    - at local midnight, so server.log only ever holds today's lines,
    - at 4 MB, the size Roll-Log.ps1 rolled at,
    - at a start, when the server.log there is from another day or full.

  A rolled file is server.log.<when it was rolled>, digits only, local time to
  the millisecond (server.log.20261012235959123). Nothing is renumbered, so a
  roll is one rename and no reader holding an older file can stop it.

  THE 30 DAYS. Every line the engine writes starts with its local time,
  "[2026-10-12 21:40:03.155]" (the site's serverLogSlice reads the same
  stamp); a line without one belongs to the line above it, which is what a
  stack trace is. At a start, at every roll and once an hour, each rolled file
  loses every line from before 30 days ago, with the unstamped lines that
  belong to them, and a file with nothing left is deleted. So no line older
  than 30 days and an hour is ever on disk, and the files Roll-Log.ps1 left
  (server.log.1 to .5, weeks in each) are cut the same way on the first start.
  A file with no stamped line at all goes by its last write, or by when it
  was made if that is earlier (a copy Roll-Log.ps1 rolled holds weeks, from
  when it was made to its last write). A line stamped without the brackets,
  "2026-10-12 21:40:03 [thornswood] ...", the gamemode's, counts too.

  WHAT IS SAID. Each roll that deletes or cuts anything, and every failure, is
  a line in server.log itself, "[<time>] [server-log] ...", stamped like the
  engine's. A file that could not be cut or deleted is named with the error,
  and the next hourly pass is the next try (another program holding a file is
  the one failure here outside our control). A write that fails is said on
  stderr at once and in server.log as soon as a write works again, with how
  much was lost; the server is never stopped or slowed over its log.

  THE SERVER IS STILL WHAT THE TASK RUNS. Its exit code is this process's
  exit code, so call exit %^errorlevel% still hands it to the task. Started
  by start /high, this runs High, and the server is set to this process's own
  priority the moment it starts, because Windows starts a child of a High
  process at Normal (Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1, #2491). Node puts the child
  in a job that ends it when this process ends, so stopping either stops both
  (measured 12 Oct: the child was gone a second after its parent was killed).
  Measured the same day: 20,000 lines written by a child that then called
  process.exit all reached the parent, so the pipe loses nothing of a crash
  that cmd's file did not.

/*
  DELETION REQUESTS, TAKEN BEFORE THE PROGRAM STARTS (#2758).

  Patrick, 18 Oct 2026, after the first real deletion on his own account: "it
  should not restart everytime we want to delete a person it should just fully
  apply the rest upon a server restart". So scripts\vps\Delete-Person.ps1
  stops nothing. It writes the request into the folder of each service that
  holds something of the person's, and each service takes it out of its own
  files as it next starts. For the game server and voice that is here: this
  process starts them, so between its start and the program's nothing else
  has those files open, and a file changed now is never written back over.

  The game server (a server-settings.json in the folder it runs). Its list is
  private\deleted-characters.json (the privDir server-settings.json names),
  the list the gamemode's release block reads at its start (#2351):

      { "profiles": [ 5001 ], "actors": [ 4278192641 ], "done": { ... } }

  Here is its part "saves": every change form of theirs in the engine's own
  folder (<databaseName, world>\changeForms, the files the engine loads at its
  start), their card (characters.json), their mod menu choices
  (mod-settings.json), their take counts (take-limit.json) and when they last
  left (last-left.json). The gamemode's blocks let go of the registers as they
  load, after this (game\gamemode.js, the release block). A part done is marked
  with the time in the list; the one that finds every part done deletes it.
  RELEASE_PARTS is the gamemode's PARTS, and tests\test-2758-start-deletions.js
  holds the two to the same list.

  An unfinished save (.pending-batch in changeForms) that holds one of their
  characters waits for the next start: the engine replays it as it starts,
  before anything could take it out, and writing it again without their
  character would mean writing the engine's own journal. Everything else of
  theirs goes now and the part waits, and the line says so. A batch that is
  not theirs is the engine's to replay and changes nothing here.

  Voice (deletion-requests.json in the folder it runs):

      { "people": [ { "discordId": "...", "profiles": [ 5001 ] } ],
        "kept": [ { "profile": 5001, "from": 99000, "to": 201000 } ] }

  Every chat line their characters wrote goes out of each day's file
  (THORNSWOOD_CHAT_DIR, or chat beside it, as voice-server.js reads it),
  except a line said inside a session staff marked kept (#2166), whose
  windows Delete-Person.ps1 read off the site. Then the list is deleted.

  A file that is there and will not parse, or a change that did not take,
  leaves the request where it is, for the next start, and is said. Each line
  here says counts and never a name, a Discord id, a profile id or a form id.
