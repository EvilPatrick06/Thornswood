.SYNOPSIS
  Says whether the monthly hands-on restore rehearsal is due, from the Last rehearsed line in docs\RESTORING.md, and fails once it is overdue.

.DESCRIPTION
  Issue #1046. Patrick ruled on 18 October 2026 that the hands-on restore
  rehearsal (restore a backup with Restore-Server.ps1 -Rehearse, start the
  folder, connect, load a character from the backup, delete the folder) runs
  monthly. Before this, nothing recorded when the last one ran in a way
  anything read, and nothing said when one was due (SERVICE-OBJECTIVES.md,
  RTO). The record is the one line people already keep:

      **Last rehearsed: 28 September 2026** (...)

  in docs\RESTORING.md. It is written by hand only after a real run, and
  this script never writes it. It reads that line, exactly once, as a day,
  a month name and a year, and counts the days to -Today.

    ok        exit 0  the last rehearsal is -Days (35) days old or less.
    overdue   exit 1  it is older than that. The nightly checks run this, so
                      an overdue rehearsal opens or adds to the board's
                      "Nightly checks failed" issue until somebody does one
                      and writes the line.
    unread    exit 3  the file is not there, has no such line, has more
                      than one, or the date does not read.

  35 days is a month with a few days' slack, so a rehearsal done on the
  same day each month never shows as overdue. It is a number, -Days, and
  a different cadence is that number and the sentence in RESTORING.md.

  It reads one file and writes nothing. -Doc and -Today stand in for the
  real ones so tests\test-1046-rehearsal-due.ps1 can run it offline.

  Run by hand from the repository folder:
      .\scripts\vps\Check-RehearsalDue.ps1
