  Bootstrap-VPS.ps1

  Run this ON THE VPS, once, in the PowerShell 5.1 that ships with Windows
  Server 2022. It brings the box up to what the Thornswood server needs and
  nothing more.

  What it installs:
    PowerShell 7   so scripts behave the same here as on the build machine
    Node 24        matching the build machine exactly
    Git (optional) only if you want to pull updates here rather than copy them
    Build Tools (optional, -IncludeBuildTools) MSBuild and the .NET Framework
                   4.8.1 targeting pack, for the build runners (below)
    Engine tools (optional, -IncludeEngineTools) the C++ compiler, CMake and
                   yarn, for the engine build's fallback on the runners (below)
    .NET runtime (optional, -IncludeSigningRuntime) what Microsoft's signing
                   client runs on, for the signing runner (below)

  What it deliberately does NOT install, unless -IncludeEngineTools asks:
    CMake, vcpkg, or the C++ half of Visual Studio Build Tools. The server
    that runs here is not built here, it is copied here already built.

  THE ENGINE TOOLS, FOR THE ENGINE BUILD'S FALLBACK (#459). Patrick decided on
  15 Oct that the engine is built in CI on GitHub's runner first and on the
  VPS runners when GitHub refuses it ("C, then B"), the way the build check
  falls back (.github\workflows\engine.yml). Measured on the box on 16 Oct:
  MSBuild from the Build Tools above, and no C++ compiler, no CMake and no
  yarn, so the fallback stops at Build-Engine.ps1's tool check. So
  -IncludeEngineTools (which takes -IncludeBuildTools with it) adds to that
  same Build Tools install, through Microsoft's own installer already on the
  box, held to its signature the same way: the "Desktop development with C++"
  workload (Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools) with what it recommends,
  the Windows SDK among them, and the CMake that comes in Visual Studio
  (Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.CMake.Project), which is where
  Build-Engine.ps1 and Build-Server.ps1 look for it: several GB, not yet
  measured on the box. And yarn, which the fork builds its client and its
  server's JavaScript half with: classic, which the fork's yarn.lock files
  are written for ("yarn lockfile v1"), the release -YarnVersion names,
  from npm, into Node's own folder, which is on every account's PATH (a
  global install goes to the profile of whoever runs it, which no runner
  account reads). Nothing is built here by it, and vcpkg is the fork's own,
  fetched with the fork by each build.

  THE BUILD TOOLS, FOR THE RUNNERS (#498, Patrick, 12 Oct: "install the Build
  Tools on the VPS runners"). The launcher is built from launcher\app\
  Thornswood.csproj and installer\setup\Setup.csproj with MSBuild, and the
  build check runs on these runners whenever GitHub's own runner is refused
  (#2393). Windows Server has no MSBuild of its own that understands those
  projects: the in-box one under Microsoft.NET drives the in-box csc, which
  knows nothing past C# 5. So -IncludeBuildTools installs the two Build Tools
  parts the projects need, MSBuild (Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.MSBuildTools,
  with the Roslyn compiler) and the .NET Framework 4.8.1 reference assemblies
  (Microsoft.Net.Component.4.8.1.TargetingPack), about 1.5 GB, and nothing
  else. Measured before it on 15 Oct: no MSBuild, no vswhere and no reference
  assemblies anywhere on the box. The bootstrapper is Microsoft's own
  aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_buildtools.exe, which has no fixed hash to pin (it
  changes with every Visual Studio servicing release), so it is held to its
  Authenticode signature instead: valid, and signed by Microsoft Corporation,
  or it is deleted unrun.

  THE .NET RUNTIME, FOR THE SIGNING RUNNER (#3312). release.yml's VPS
  fallback signs on runner 3 with Microsoft's signing client, whose dlib runs
  on .NET (its README: "Install .NET 8.0 Runtime" for x64 signtool). Measured
  by the Cloud Desk on 23 Oct: the box had no .NET runtime at all and no
  winget, so Setup-ShipMachine.ps1's winget line cannot put one here. So
  -IncludeSigningRuntime installs one exact .NET runtime release from
  Microsoft's own download host, held to the SHA-512 Microsoft publishes for
  it in https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/<major>/releases.json
  and to its Authenticode signature (Valid, by Microsoft's ".NET"
  certificate, CN=.NET, O=Microsoft Corporation), or the download is deleted
  unrun. It is
  .NET 10, not 8: the client's runtimeconfig asks for net8.0 with rollForward
  "Major", so it runs on the newest runtime there is when 8 is absent, and
  .NET 8's support ends on 10 Nov 2026 while 10's runs to 14 Nov 2028.
  Machine wide, into Program Files\dotnet, where the runner account's
  signtool finds it. Like Node, one release, bumped on purpose: a security
  release of 10 is a new -DotnetRuntimeVersion and -DotnetRuntimeSha512 here
  and this run again.

  On the Node version: scam_native.node is a Node-API addon (it exports
  napi_register_module_v1 and links node-addon-api), and Node-API is ABI stable
  across major versions, so the 22.11.0 already on this box would load it. 24 is
  installed anyway so that "does the addon match the runtime" never has to be
  asked again.

  winget does not exist on Windows Server 2022, so everything here is a direct
  MSI. PowerShell 7 and Git are resolved at download time. Node is not: it is
  one exact release with the SHA-256 nodejs.org publishes for it, because the
  newest v24 on the day is whatever the next fresh box happens to get, and
  nodejs.org keeps every release at the same address, so that URL does not rot.
