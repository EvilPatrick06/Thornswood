<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Runs ON THE VPS, sent there by Harden-VPS.ps1: turns ssh password login off, turns Remote Desktop off and the Windows services and telemetry the box never uses, and moves Windows Update and its maintenance to 4 AM, leaving ssh on port 22 alone.

.DESCRIPTION
  Do not run this by hand. Harden-VPS.ps1 proves key login works first, from
  your machine, and refuses to send this otherwise; run that instead. It
  sends this file's text on ssh's standard input and Windows PowerShell 5.1
  runs it from there, so nothing of it is ever written on the box (#3035).

  In this order, each step saying what it found and what it did:

    Remote Desktop   fDenyTSConnections set to 1, every enabled inbound allow
                     rule in the Remote Desktop group or on port 3389 turned
                     off, and the Remote Desktop service stopped and set to
                     Disabled. A rule that also covers port 22 is never
                     touched, and neither are the rules that allow ssh.
    services         the Windows services in $IdleServices below, which a
                     box that runs game servers, a site, a bot and build
                     runners with nobody signed in never uses, each stopped
                     and set to Disabled, with the reason beside it (#3186).
                     One that is not installed is said and left.
    telemetry        the scheduled tasks in $TelemetryTasks below
                     (DiskSnapshot.exe, CompatTelRunner.exe and the Customer
                     Experience Improvement Program) set to Disabled, and
                     AllowTelemetry set to 0, with the reason beside each
                     (#3213). One that is not on the box is said and left.
    Windows Update   the policy values in $UpdatePolicies below: updates
                     install every day at 4 AM box time, Windows never
                     restarts for one between 6 AM and midnight, and its
                     automatic maintenance starts at 4 AM with no random
                     delay (#3213). Windows Update itself stays on: its
                     services are read and left as they are, and a WARN
                     says so if one is Disabled. A WARN too if the box's
                     clock is not Mountain time, since every hour here is
                     the box's own.
    sshd_config     PasswordAuthentication no and KbdInteractiveAuthentication
                     no, as the first setting of each (sshd takes the first
                     one it reads) and above the Match block, where a global
                     setting has to be. The new file is checked with
                     sshd -t before it replaces the old one, and the old one
                     is kept beside it as sshd_config.before-harden-<time>,
                     which only SYSTEM and Administrators may read (#3034).
    restart          sshd is restarted by a one time scheduled task a few
                     seconds after this returns, so the answer gets back
                     before the connection goes. A second task puts the old
                     sshd_config back and restarts sshd ten minutes later
                     unless Harden-VPS.ps1 cancels it after proving key login
                     still works: if the change ever locked the key out, the
                     box undoes it on its own.

  Every line of output starts with one word: CHANGED, WOULD (with -DryRun),
  ALREADY, KEPT, WARN or STOP. STOP means nothing after it was done, and the
  exit code is 1.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  Read everything, change nothing, and say WOULD for each change.

.PARAMETER SshdConfig
  The sshd_config to change. The Windows OpenSSH server's own by default.

.PARAMETER Sshd
  The sshd.exe that checks the new file (sshd -t) before it is used.

.PARAMETER Layer
  A file that replaces the functions below that touch Windows (the registry,
  the firewall, services, scheduled tasks, the clock's time zone, sshd -t,
  the copy's rules). Only
  tests\test-harden-vps.ps1 passes it, to run this against stand-ins.

# Policy values Windows reads as Group Policy (#3213), each with why. Patrick,
# 22 Oct (docs\DECIDED.md): telemetry off, and Windows Update and its
# maintenance run 4 AM to 6 AM box time, at low priority, after the 2:15 AM
# backup. The box's clock is Mountain time, the backup starts at 08:15 UTC
# and the nightly checks at 09:00 UTC, so in box time those are 2:15 AM and
# 3:00 AM in summer and 1:15 AM and 2:00 AM in winter, and the shares have
# 45 minutes each: 4 AM is clear of both all year, and nobody is on before
# 7 AM. On 22 Oct the box had AUOptions 7 (Server's download, then wait for
# somebody to install and restart) and nothing else, so Windows staged
# updates whenever it chose, its maintenance started at its default of 2 AM,
# beside the backup, and UpdateOrchestrator\Reboot_AC was set to restart the
# box by itself at 6:08 AM on 23 Oct.
#
# Each key is one Server 2022's own Group Policy templates write: the update
# ones WindowsUpdate.admx, the maintenance ones msched.admx and
# AllowTelemetry DataCollection.admx. What Server 2022 has no key for is an
# install on a schedule with the restart left to us. Option 4 restarts by
# itself, outside active hours, when an update needs it; option 7 never
# installs by itself, and Windows had set Reboot_AC under it all the same;
# and NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers holds a restart off only while somebody
# is signed in, which on this box nobody is, so it is not set. So the
# restart is held to the night instead: active hours are the 18 hours
# Windows allows at most (ActiveHoursMaxRange is 8 to 18), 6 AM to midnight,
# so a restart for the 4 AM install comes before 6 AM or not until midnight.
# One still waiting at 6 AM can also be done by Set-TimeWait.ps1 -Restart,
# which restarts the box only when nobody is on either server. The hour Windows looks for
# updates and downloads them has no key outside WSUS (DetectionFrequency
# needs an update server of our own), so only the install is moved. Low
# priority: Windows already runs its update installer (TiWorker.exe) and the
# maintenance tasks at its own background priority, and there is no
# documented setting that lowers them further, so none is set.
