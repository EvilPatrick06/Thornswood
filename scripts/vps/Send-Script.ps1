  Send-Script.ps1

  The one way a script here runs PowerShell on the VPS. Dot-source it beside
  Vps.ps1:

      . (Join-Path $Here '..\vps\Send-Script.ps1')
      function Remote($script) { Invoke-ThornswoodRemote -Target "$User@$Vps" -SshArgs $ssh -Script $script }

  WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #1070). Seventeen scripts carried their own copy of
  Remote($script), and four more a copy of their own under another name.
  Over 6,000 characters each copy sent the script as a file to one fixed path
  on the VPS (C:/Windows/Temp/thornswood-remote.ps1 in seventeen of them), so
  two runs at once, from two machines or a lane and a person, could run or
  delete each other's script. And each copy ran the file, then removed it,
  and the removal's exit code was the last one the caller saw, so a script
  that failed on the far side looked like one that worked.

  WHAT IT DOES. Under the limit the script goes on the command line, one
  round trip. Over it, scp copies the script to the box as a file of its own
  name, and one ssh call runs a short runner on the command line, which reads
  the file, deletes it, and only then runs what it read. $LASTEXITCODE
  afterwards is the far side's.

  Why not the command line: sshd on Windows hands the command to cmd.exe,
  which stops at 8,191 characters and says nothing, and base64 of UTF-16 is
  about 2.7 times the script. On 17 and 20 September a long block arrived cut
  in half and the far side complained about a brace in a script nobody could
  see. Standard input has no such limit.

  Why not standard input (issue #3059). From 21 Oct 2026 (#3036) a long
  script went on ssh's standard input, and on the box it hung: measured that
  day from One, the box's sshd hands a command its standard input whole only
  up to about 8 KB. Over that, whether the rest and the end of input arrive
  is chance, session by session, whichever way the far side reads (Install-
  Runner's 135,700 byte firewall script never arrived; a 16 KB line arrived
  for one reader and not for three others). Nothing written after the
  session starts arrives at all (#2912). So standard input carries only a
  short value now (-Stdin, at most 8,000 bytes, the size that arrived every
  time), and a long script goes by scp, which carries any size.

  Why the file is removed by the run that reads it (issues #3027 and #3059).
  Until 21 Oct 2026 the file was run with -File by a second ssh call and
  removed by a third, so a run cut before the third (a bridge reset, the
  machine running it going away) left the file on the box. Now the runner
  deletes it before it runs anything, so a run that starts leaves nothing,
  however it ends. What is left is a run cut between its copy and its run, a
  few seconds: the box gives no sign that the run is gone (the end of
  standard input never arrives, and a far process outlives its ssh session,
  measured 21 Oct, #3064). So each runner also deletes every such file older
  than ten minutes, which no live run can still own, and a file a cut run
  leaves goes with the next long run after that. The runner runs the script
  the way -File ran the file: an exit inside it is the far side's exit code,
  an error that stops it is 1, and otherwise 0.

  Host key checking is always on (issues #450 and #1078): a caller's own
  weaker StrictHostKeyChecking is refused before anything is sent, because
  ssh takes the first value it is given for an option and a weaker one would
  win over the one added here.

  A secret never goes through here as part of the script: Send-Secret.ps1
  puts it on standard input, and uses this for the rest.

  A warning ssh prints on stderr is not a failure (issue #941): ssh and scp
  run inside Invoke-ThornswoodNative (Vps.ps1), so the OpenSSH post-quantum
  warning does not stop a Windows PowerShell 5.1 caller, and whether the far
  side ran is ssh's exit code, the same under PowerShell 7.
