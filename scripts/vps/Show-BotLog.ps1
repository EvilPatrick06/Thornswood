  Show-BotLog.ps1

  What the bot has been saying, without redeploying it to find out.

      .\Show-BotLog.ps1            the bot's own lines, last 40
      .\Show-BotLog.ps1 -All       discord.py's websocket noise as well
      .\Show-BotLog.ps1 -Lines 200 further back

  The log on the VPS holds two things mixed together: what the bot itself
  prints, which is the part written for a person to read, and discord.py's
  own logging, which is a wall of "Can't keep up, shard ID None". The second
  one drowns the first, which is exactly how a bot that was telling you what
  was wrong went unread for a week. So the bot's lines are what this shows
  unless you ask for the rest.
