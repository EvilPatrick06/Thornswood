  Lock-Folder.ps1

  The one place the creators of the VPS service folders get their lock from
  (follow-up to issues #1183 and #1691): Watch-Services.ps1 and Watch-Load.ps1
  for C:\Thornswood-Watch, Setup-Domain.ps1 for C:\Thornswood-Caddy, and
  Artifact.ps1 and Swap.ps1 for C:\Thornswood-Deploys. Dot-sourced on this
  machine; the far side gets the function as text inside the script that is
  sent, since those scripts run ON the VPS through Send-Script.ps1.

  The rules are the ones Lock-VpsFolders.ps1 applies, so a folder made from now
  on starts the way Lock-VpsFolders leaves an old one:
    takes nothing from above; SYSTEM, Administrators and the account running
    it have Full Control; every rule by name stays; Users, Everyone,
    Authenticated Users and CREATOR OWNER go. -Only also takes off every rule
    by name but those three (private, the backups, Dumps).
  Only a folder this makes is locked. One that is already there is left to
  Lock-VpsFolders.ps1, which knows what the bot and the site must keep first.

  tests\test-vps-folders-on-create.ps1 runs it and each creator's text
  against scratch folders, and checks it leaves the same rules as
  Lock-VpsFolders.ps1.
