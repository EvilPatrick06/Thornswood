  Restore-Backup.ps1

  Opens one of the nightly backups: checks it has not been tampered with,
  decrypts it, and unpacks it into a folder you name. Runs on this machine and
  touches nothing on the VPS, so it is safe to run whenever you want to know
  whether the backups are real.

      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Backup.ps1 -Backup ...\thornswood-20260918-030000.zip.enc
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Backup.ps1 -Backup ...\thornswood-...enc -To C:\test-restore -Work C:\ThornswoodTemps&Worktrees\temp\restore
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Backup.ps1 -Backup ...\thornswood-...enc -CheckOnly

  The passphrase is the one in the key file that Install-Backup.ps1 made. Pass
  -KeyFile to point at your copy of it. It is never printed and never written
  anywhere by this script.

  -CheckOnly verifies the signature, then reads the numbered change forms
  under game/world in the zip (0.json, 1.json, ...: a slot, not a profile id).
  It fails when none of them has a profile id above 0 that is not deleted, the
  same question Restore-Server.ps1 asks of a world (#1047). A world of only
  deleted slots, or only change forms that are not characters, is not a backup
  of anyone. That is worth running on a schedule: it is the difference between
  having backups and believing you do.

  Putting what comes out back onto the server is docs\RESTORING.md. This
  script deliberately does not do that part. Writing over a live world folder
  is not something a script should be able to do by accident.

  -Work is where the decrypted zip is written while this runs. Left out, that
  is %TEMP%. The zip holds the bot token and the site keys, so it is deleted
  before this exits, whether the backup was unpacked or the run was refused.
  -To is the folder the backup is unpacked into, and is not -Work.

#              or '..' part, no empty part (a doubled slash), no control or
