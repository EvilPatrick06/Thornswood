  Box-Run.ps1

  Runs one verb of the deploy gate on the box (#2841), from any session gh
  is signed in on, a cloud thread included, with no key to the box:

      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Deploy-DevGamemode -Restart'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Deploy-Docs -Site'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Get-Logs -Dev -Lines 2000'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Rebuild-ContentTables -Server dev'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Deploy-Server -GamemodeOnly -Build <main's full commit>'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Watch-Services -Install'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'Hold-Server -Service dev -Why "swapping the ledger" -Minutes 45'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Line 'ping'
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 -Run 1234567890     read an earlier run again

  scripts\vps\gate\verbs.json is the whole list of verbs and the switches
  each takes; a line outside it is refused here before anything starts, and
  again on the box. What runs is always that script of main as main is on
  GitHub when the box reads it, never this checkout. A live verb
  (Deploy-Server, Publish-Server-Main) names the commit of main Patrick gave
  his word for with -Build, and the box refuses it once main is anywhere
  else.

  HOW. It starts box-run.yml on main of the private ops repository,
  EvilPatrick06/Thornswood-Ops, where the VPS runners are registered since
  this repository went public (#4013), with the line. That run checks out
  this repository's main, takes a box runner and the desk's deploy key out
  of the ops repository's "desk" environment, which only main may use
  (Grant-BoxAccess.ps1 -Deploy puts it there), and asks the gate over the box's own sshd on 127.0.0.1 with
  this script's -OnTheBox half. The key logs in as thornswood-deploy and can
  only hand the gate a line (scripts\vps\gate\Gate.ps1).

  WHAT COMES BACK, AND TO WHOM. A deploy prints paths and a Get-Logs run
  brings back the servers' logs, and a run's log and files are readable by
  everyone who can read the repository it runs in. So the run's log carries only the
  verb, main's commit and the exit code. Everything the verb printed and
  every file it wrote is sealed on the runner to a key made here for this
  run alone (RSA-OAEP over an AES-GCM key) and written into the run's log
  as TWSEAL-LOG lines (scripts\ops\Sealed.ps1 says why the log and not an
  artifact). Only the private half, kept in this machine's scratch folder
  (box-run\<run>.key, readable by this account only), opens it, and this
  prints the output and puts the files in box-run\<run>\.

  Exit code: the verb's own, or 1 when it was refused, or the answer could
  not be read.
