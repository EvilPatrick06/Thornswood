  Renew-BoxKey.ps1

  Gives one of the two keys a workflow of the ops repository holds a new key
  pair, on the box, and puts the new private half straight into that
  workflow's GitHub environment (#2862, Patrick's A on the report page's
  q-retire-box-keys, 31 Oct 2026: box keys are renewed from the cloud, never
  made new, and never from One). The deploy gate's verb Renew-BoxKey runs it,
  as SYSTEM, so a cloud session renews a key with

      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 Renew-BoxKey -Which desk      the desk key: box-run.yml's DESK_KEY_B64
      pwsh scripts/vps/Box-Run.ps1 Renew-BoxKey -Which notices   the notices key: staff-notice.yml's NOTICE_KEY_B64

  Until now only Grant-BoxAccess.ps1 -MakeKey -ToEnvironment on One did it.

  RENEW ONLY. Each -Which is one key the box already holds, fixed here: its
  name, the file its line is in, the environment and secret it goes into.
  The new line takes the old line's options word for word (from="127.0.0.1",
  restrict, and the forced command: the deploy gate for desk, say-staff.ps1
  as claude for notices), and the run stops, changing nothing, when there is
  no such line or its options are not those. No new name, person, file or
  environment can come of it; Grant-BoxAccess.ps1 stays the way to make one.
  The private half is written nowhere but a folder only SYSTEM and
  Administrators may open, for the length of the run, and into the secret by
  gh's standard input; nothing prints it.

  THE ORDER, so the key that works is never taken away before its successor
  is proved:
    1. the box admin App's token for the ops repository's environments
       (scripts\vps\admin\ops-access.js keys, Environments write and nothing
       more), and a read that the environment lets in main alone, so no
       branch's workflow can read what goes into it. Nothing has changed yet.
    2. a new ed25519 pair, and its line put on BESIDE the old one.
    3. a new login with it, from this box to its own sshd on 127.0.0.1, its
       host key held to scripts\vps\vps.json's pins. The forced command has
       to answer as itself and must not run the command asked for: say-staff
       says READY to an empty input; the gate's Gate.ps1 says the broker did
       not answer, because the broker is busy running this very verb (or
       GATE READY, were it free). sshd refusing the key ends it here.
    4. the new private half into the secret, with gh and that token.
    5. only then the old line comes off, and the file is read back.
  A failure before 5 puts the key file back byte for byte, so the old key
  works as before and the secret is unchanged (a failure in 4 means GitHub
  refused it). The next box-run.yml or staff-notice.yml run is the proof
  that the secret holds the new key; before it, nothing else holds it.

  It stops when the put back of a Grant-BoxAccess.ps1 run is still armed
  ("Thornswood box access put back"), which would put an older key file
  back over this change ten minutes after that run.

  PowerShell 7 (the gate runs its verbs with it).
