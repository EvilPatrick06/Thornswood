  ship-access.js

  An installation token of the "Thornswood box admin" App for one Ship
  through the deploy gate (#2841, Patrick's pick on 30 Oct 2026: the box
  admin App mints a token, so a dev Ship runs on the box end to end). Run by
  scripts\release\Ship-OnBox.ps1, as SYSTEM under the gate's broker, which is
  the one account besides the admin service's own task and Administrators
  that may read the App's key.

      node scripts/vps/admin/ship-access.js            the token, on its own line

  WHAT IT CAN DO. Only what a Ship from the feed asks GitHub for: Actions
  write on the engine fork (start thornswood-sign-manifest.yml, read its run,
  download the signed catalog) and on Thornswood (release-tag.yml and
  release.yml, for a Ship that carries a new launcher), and Contents read on
  Thornswood (the launcher release.yml signed). GitHub ends it after an hour,
  and nothing keeps it: Ship-OnBox.ps1 hands it to gh through GH_TOKEN for
  that run alone. The installation only gives it these once Patrick has added
  Actions write on the App's page and accepted it on the installation; until
  then GitHub refuses, and that refusal is what this prints.

  The key is read and never shown, logged or sent; only the App's own short
  token (appJwt in admin.js) goes to GitHub.

      THORNSWOOD_ADMIN_STATE         the App's state folder; C:\Thornswood-Admin\state when unset
      THORNSWOOD_ADMIN_GITHUB_API    https://api.github.com when unset (the harness points it at a stand-in)
