  admin.js

  The box's GitHub admin service (#3107, Patrick's A of 22 Oct 2026). A cloud
  Claude thread cannot make a repository-admin call: the cloud environment's
  proxy refuses every actions/runners, variables, secrets and environments
  path (measured 22 Oct 2026, 10:20 AM), and a workflow's own token has no
  permission for any of them. So a GitHub App made for Thornswood holds that
  right, its key lives here and nowhere else, and this is the only thing
  that uses it.

  WHAT IT DOES. It makes GitHub's admin settings match what this
  repository's main records, or says where the App is installed, and
  nothing else:
    runner-labels   every records/<name>-runners.json on main, { label,
                    runners }: the runners it lists (thornswood-vps is 1,
                    thornswood-vps-<n> is n) carry the label and no other
                    runner does. The runners are registered to the private
                    ops repository, ThornswoodRP/Thornswood-Ops, since
                    this one went public (#4013, Patrick's A on #3685).
                    records/build-runners.json is the build cap
                    (#2994). A record may also list off-box runners by
                    name (offBox, thornswood-pr-*), which carry its label
                    too (build runners on One, 26 Oct 2026); they never
                    carry thornswood-vps, so box-only jobs never reach
                    them. It stops for a record whose runners GitHub does
                    not have, since every job asking for its label would
                    then wait for a runner that never comes. A label of
                    our own that no record names any more comes off every
                    runner, so a record taken off main takes its label with
                    it (#4033: thornswood-sign stayed on runner 3 after
                    the box stopped signing, since only a record's own
                    label was ever looked at).
    repo-about      records/repo-about.json on main, { description,
                    homepage, topics }: the About box a stranger sees on
                    the repository's front page (#3682, Patrick's A of 26
                    Oct 2026). A cloud thread's proxy refuses repository
                    settings writes ("Repository settings writes are not
                    permitted through this proxy", measured 26 Oct 2026,
                    5:13 PM), and the App's administration write covers
                    them. It stops for a record that is not a plain line,
                    an https website, or GitHub's own topic shape.
    settings        reads, and changes nothing (#3534): the Actions settings
                    (on or off, which actions may run, the workflow token's
                    default, sharing, log and artifact retention, fork pull
                    requests), the runners, and the names (never the values,
                    which GitHub never gives) of the secrets and variables of
                    the repository and of each environment
                    records/github-settings.json on main names. A name the
                    App has no permission to read is said, with the
                    permission it needs, instead of being read.
    installation-repos
                    the repositories the App is installed on, read with a
                    token that can read their metadata and nothing more, and
                    nothing changed (#4013: the App has to be on
                    Thornswood-Ops before the runners move there).
    repo-settings   records/github-repo-settings.json on main (#3683,
                    Patrick's answers of 26 Oct 2026), { repositories: [{
                    repository, rulesets: [...],
                    private_vulnerability_reporting, immutable_releases,
                    secret_scanning, secret_scanning_push_protection,
                    allow_auto_merge, collaborators: [login] }] },
                    for Thornswood and
                    the engine fork, ThornswoodRP/skymp, and no other
                    repository: each ruleset an entry names is on GitHub
                    with exactly its target, enforcement, conditions, rules
                    and bypass list, made or put back by name, and private
                    vulnerability reporting, immutable releases, secret
                    scanning and its push protection, and auto-merge, are
                    each on or off as the entry says (left as they are when the entry does not
                    say). An App or a deploy key may bypass only a tag
                    ruleset: a record that lets one bypass a branch
                    ruleset stops the run (the redesign's part 20). A
                    ruleset GitHub has that the record does not name
                    is never deleted here; it stops the run, named, so a
                    protection nobody wrote down is a pull request to the
                    record or a deliberate removal, never a silent loss. A repository
                    the App is not installed on stops the run for it, with
                    the link to the installation's settings, and the others
                    go on. An entry's collaborators, when it gives them, is
                    the whole list of people besides the owner who may push
                    there (a personal repository has no other role): one
                    GitHub has that the list does not name is taken off,
                    and an invitation to one is withdrawn, so a person who
                    leaves the team is a pull request to the record (31 Oct
                    2026). It only ever takes people off. One the list names
                    who is not there yet is reported and nothing is sent
                    for them: giving somebody push is Patrick's by hand on
                    GitHub, never a merged pull request through this App.
                    An entry that gives no list leaves its people as they
                    are.
  What to do comes from Thornswood's main, read through the App, never from the caller,
  so whoever asks can only make GitHub match main. A change is a pull
  request to the record.

  WHO MAY ASK. A run of the ops repository's .github/workflows/
  github-admin.yml on its main, and nothing else: it sends the OIDC token
  GitHub gave that run, for the audience thornswood-admin, and this checks it
  against GitHub's published keys (fetched each time) and its claims:
  GitHub's issuer, the audience, not expired, the ops repository,
  refs/heads/main, that exact workflow on main, started by hand or by its
  nightly schedule. A scheduled run may only check (CHANGING_ASKS): its
  repository settings check opens one issue on the board while GitHub
  differs from the record and closes it once it matches. A push here
  cannot start it there, so the Desk runs Set-BuildRunners.ps1 (with
  -RepoSettings for the repository settings) or Set-RepoAbout.ps1 after a
  merge that changes a record. A pull request's
  run has another ref
  and another workflow ref, so it cannot. No secret is involved: the token
  is GitHub's word for which run is asking.

  WHERE. 127.0.0.1:7791. Caddy carries https://thornswood.net/github-app/ to
  it for the App's one-time setup only (scripts\deploy\Caddyfile), and
  anything that came through Caddy (it has X-Forwarded-For) is refused
  everything but the setup pages.

  THE APP'S SETUP. Install-AdminService.ps1 -Setup arms it: state\setup.json
  with a one-time state and an hour to live, and prints the address
  https://thornswood.net/github-app/setup?state=<state>. That page sends the
  App's manifest to GitHub (name, no webhook, private, administration write
  and contents read on the repositories it is installed on, and since #3534
  read of the names of its secrets, variables and environments, never their
  values, Environments write for an environment's secret, which only
  ops-access.js keys asks for (Renew-BoxKey.ps1), Issues write for the
  Discord bot's token (#5260), and since #2841's Ship verbs Actions write,
  which only ship-access.js asks for, and Deployments write, which only the
  deploy agent asks for (tools/DeployAgent, #5180); records/github-apps.json is the list
  and the nightly checks the App against it); Patrick creates
  it, GitHub sends him back to /setup/done with a one-time code, and this
  trades the code for the App's key straight from GitHub. The key goes into
  state\key.pem, the App's id and name into state\app.json, the setup is
  disarmed, and the page links the App's install page. The key is never
  shown, logged or sent anywhere. An App another account made is refused.

  It logs one line per request: what was asked, by which run, and what
  changed. Never a token or the key.
