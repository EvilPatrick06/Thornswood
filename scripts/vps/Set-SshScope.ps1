.SYNOPSIS
  Limits which addresses may reach ssh on the VPS (port 22), after proving key login, refusing a list that leaves this machine out, and with a put back the box runs by itself if the new login fails.

.DESCRIPTION
  Issue #2182, decision 2 (Patrick, 11 Oct 2026): restrict the inbound rules on
  port 22 to known addresses, and only once the hosting provider's console
  login is confirmed working, because the console is the way back in if no
  address in the list can reach ssh any more. This script does not check the
  console; the person running it does that first.

  Runs on your machine. In this order, and it stops at the first thing that
  is not right, with nothing changed:

    1. The box's own key. known_hosts here must hold the host key
       scripts\vps\vps.json pins.
    2. Key login, before anything else.
    3. On the box: scripts\vps\vps-ssh-scope.ps1 is copied to C:\Windows\Temp
       and run there (it deletes itself). It refuses a list that does not
       hold the address this session comes from, a rule for every port that
       would let 22 in anyway, and a rule for 22 shared with other ports.
       Then it saves the rules' remote addresses as they are, arms a task
       that puts them back in ten minutes ("Thornswood ssh scope rollback"),
       and sets each port 22 rule's remote addresses to the list.
    4. After: a NEW key login from here, which only gets in if this machine's
       address really is allowed. Only then is the put back task cancelled.
       If the login fails, nothing is cancelled and the box puts the old
       rules back by itself within ten minutes.
    5. The port 22 rules as the box now has them.

  -WhatIf does steps 1 and 2 and runs step 3 read only: it prints what WOULD
  change.

  -From Any opens port 22 to every address again, the same way.

  -From None shuts port 22 to every outside address (#2891): the rules take
  127.0.0.1 alone, which is how the bridge reaches sshd, so the only way in
  is the bridge, each machine with its own key and token
  (Grant-BoxAccess.ps1). It only runs from a machine whose ssh already goes
  through the bridge, and the new login that proves it goes the same way. A
  home address that changes then stops nothing. The way back when the
  bridge or Caddy is down is the console, below.

  With a list of addresses instead, every address that needs ssh has to be
  in it: this machine, every other machine that deploys or ships (each
  developer's own). A home address that changes drops out of the list and that
  machine loses ssh until the list is changed from a machine still in it, or
  from the console.

  THE WAY BACK, BY HAND, if no machine can reach ssh (an address list that
  lost its address, or with None the bridge or Caddy down). The VPS
  provider's panel (BisectHosting, VirtFusion) has a console for the server
  that does not use the network: open the server there, open its VNC
  console, sign in as Administrator with the Windows password, and in
  PowerShell. With None, start the bridge and Caddy first, which is all a
  stopped one needs:
      Start-ScheduledTask 'Thornswood Bridge'; Start-ScheduledTask 'Thornswood Web'
  To put the rules back as they were before the last change instead:
      Get-ChildItem C:\ProgramData\ssh\ssh-scope-before-*.json
      $s = Get-Content -Raw <the newest of those> | ConvertFrom-Json
      foreach ($r in $s.rules) { Set-NetFirewallRule -Name $r.name -RemoteAddress @($r.remote) }

.PARAMETER From
  The addresses that may reach port 22, comma separated: 203.0.113.7,
  198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/48, or Any, or None (only the bridge).

.PARAMETER Vps
  The box's address. vps.json's by default.

.PARAMETER User
  The account the scripts log in as. vps.json's by default (Administrator).

.PARAMETER KnownHosts
  The known_hosts file that must already hold the pinned key.

.PARAMETER SettleSeconds
  How long to wait after the change before the new login. 3 by default.

.PARAMETER NoPause
  Do not wait for Enter before closing.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\vps\Set-SshScope.ps1 -From 203.0.113.7,198.51.100.20 -WhatIf
  Proves key login and says what would change. Changes nothing.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\vps\Set-SshScope.ps1 -From 203.0.113.7,198.51.100.20
  Makes the change, then proves a new key login from here still gets in.
