  Setup-SshKey.ps1

  Sets a PC up to reach the box over ssh, through the bridge, with a key and
  a token of its own (#2891). Every script that touches the box shells out
  to ssh and scp; after this they all go through, with no password and
  nothing typed.

      .\scripts\vps\Setup-SshKey.ps1          set it up, or finish setting it up
      .\scripts\vps\Setup-SshKey.ps1 -Test    only check, change nothing
      .\scripts\vps\Setup-SshKey.ps1 -NewBox  a box with no bridge yet (a move,
                                             docs\MOVING-THE-SERVER.md)

  HOW IT GETS IN. Port 22 on the box takes no outside address, so a home
  address that changes stops nothing. ssh goes inside a WebSocket on 443
  instead: connect.js, as ssh's ProxyCommand, opens
  wss://thornswood.net/box/ with this PC's token, Caddy hands it to the
  bridge on the box, and the bridge joins it to the box's own sshd. sshd
  then takes this PC's key, which the box accepts only through the bridge.
  The person's guide is docs\BOX-ACCESS.md.

  IN ORDER, each step skipped when it is already done, so it is run again
  until the last one passes:
    1. The key, .ssh\thornswood_ed25519, made here with no passphrase. Its
       private half never leaves this PC.
    2. The bridge client (connect.js and the two files it needs), copied to
       .ssh\thornswood-bridge, and a Host block for the box in .ssh\config
       that sends ssh through it (Set-ThornswoodBridgeSsh in Vps.ps1).
    3. The token, which Patrick makes for this PC with Grant-BoxAccess.ps1
       from the public key line this prints. It is asked for here, typed or
       pasted where nothing shows it, and kept in .ssh\thornswood-box-token,
       readable by this account only. Enter alone stops here until it comes.
    4. The box's own key, asked for through the bridge and written into
       known_hosts only when scripts\vps\vps.json pins it (issue #450).
    5. A login, which proves all of it.

  -NEWBOX. A new box has no bridge and still takes the Administrator
  password on port 22, so the first key goes on that way: ssh asks for the
  password once, on the line below where it says so, and nothing here reads
  it. The Host block it writes goes straight to port 22. Then
  Install-Bridge.ps1, and Grant-BoxAccess.ps1 -Name one -ThisMachine, which
  writes the bridge block over this one. A box that takes no password
  (Harden-VPS.ps1 has run) refuses it, and the console is the way in.

  NEEDS: the OpenSSH Client (Windows ships it: Settings, Apps, Optional
  features) and node (https://nodejs.org, the LTS), both on PATH.
