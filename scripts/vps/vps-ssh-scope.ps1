.SYNOPSIS
  Runs ON THE VPS, sent there by Set-SshScope.ps1: limits who may reach ssh on port 22 to a list of addresses, refusing a list that leaves out the machine running it, and arms a ten minute put back.

.DESCRIPTION
  Do not run this by hand. Set-SshScope.ps1 proves key login works first, from
  your machine, then sends this file's text on ssh's standard input and
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs it from there, so nothing of it is ever
  written on the box (#3035).

  Issue #2182, decision 2 (Patrick, 11 Oct 2026): restrict the inbound rules on
  port 22 to known addresses, only after the hosting console login is
  confirmed. In this order, each step saying what it found and what it did:

    the list      every entry an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a range written
                  address/bits, or the single word Any (back to anywhere),
                  or the single word None (no outside address: 127.0.0.1
                  alone, which is the bridge, #2891). Anything else stops it.
    the caller    the address this ssh session comes from, read from
                  SSH_CLIENT, must be inside the list. A list that leaves it
                  out would cut this machine off, so it stops.
    the rules     every enabled inbound Allow rule for TCP on port 22. An
                  enabled Allow rule for every port that also takes sshd's
                  traffic (any program or sshd.exe, no app container, any
                  service or sshd) would let 22 in from
                  anywhere whatever the list says, so it stops and names it.
                  So does finding no rule for 22 at all.
    the change    the rules' remote addresses are saved to
                  C:\ProgramData\ssh\ssh-scope-before-<time>.json, which only
                  SYSTEM and Administrators may read (#3034), a task puts
                  them back in ten minutes ("Thornswood ssh scope rollback"),
                  and then each rule's remote address becomes the list.
                  Set-SshScope.ps1 cancels the task once a new key login from
                  your machine gets in. A connection already open stays open,
                  so this answer always gets back.

  Every line of output starts with one word: CHANGED, WOULD (with -DryRun),
  ALREADY, KEPT, WARN, STOP or DONE. STOP means nothing after it was done, and
  the exit code is 1.

.PARAMETER From
  The addresses that may reach port 22, comma separated: 203.0.113.7,
  198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/48, or Any, or None.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  Read everything, change nothing, and say WOULD for each change.

.PARAMETER Layer
  A file that replaces the functions below that touch Windows (the firewall,
  scheduled tasks, SSH_CLIENT, the save folder, the save's rules). Only
  tests\test-ssh-scope.ps1 passes it, to run this against stand-ins.
