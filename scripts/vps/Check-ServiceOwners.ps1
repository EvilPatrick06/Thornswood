  Check-ServiceOwners.ps1

      .\scripts\vps\Check-ServiceOwners.ps1

  Reads, and changes nothing: whether one box service can still reach what
  another makes through LOCAL SERVICE, the account they all run as (#4077).

  For every C:\Thornswood* folder but the build runners' (which run as
  accounts of their own), it counts what LOCAL SERVICE owns, because a
  file's owner may read and change its rules, and every Allow rule that
  names LOCAL SERVICE and lets it read, run, or change rules or owner; a rule
  that only writes, the crash dump folder's, is allowed. For every task
  that runs as LOCAL SERVICE it says whether the task starts through
  thornswood-owner.exe, which makes what the service makes its own
  (scripts\deploy\ServiceAccount.ps1). Each installer puts that right on its
  next run; the ops repo's run note for #4077 lists them.

  Ends with NO SERVICE REACHES ANOTHER and exit 0, or LOCAL SERVICE STILL
  REACHES and exit 1, naming each folder and task. It reads every file's
  rules, so it takes a minute or two.
