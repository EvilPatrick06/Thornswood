  Watch-Services.ps1

      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Services.ps1            what the watcher has seen lately
      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Services.ps1 -Install   put the watcher on the server
      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Services.ps1 -Remove    take it off again
      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Services.ps1 -SetWebhook  where messages go when the bot is down

  Everything runs on one box now. The website, the game, the bot and the voice
  server are four things that can stop on their own, and nothing up there
  notices when one does. Somebody turns up, cannot get in, and the first you
  hear about it is a message in Discord hours later.

  This puts a small watcher on the server that looks at all of them every
  five minutes and starts back up whatever is not answering.

  It will not fight a service that is properly broken. Three restarts of the
  same thing inside an hour and it stops trying and writes that it needs a
  look, because a thing that crashes on startup restarted forever is a thing
  nobody ever finds out about.

  Somebody is told (issue #447). Each run decides, for everything it watches,
  whether it is down, and keeps that in outages.txt. The first run that finds
  a thing down writes ONE message saying what died and when; the message
  saying it is back comes once it has answered on two runs in a row, so a
  service that flaps is one outage and two messages, not two every five
  minutes. A thing that answers on its port but fails its health check is
  told about after two runs in a row, and is never restarted for it.

  The messages go into alerts.jsonl beside watch.log, one JSON line each (id,
  at, service, kind, text), and the same sentence goes into watch.log. The
  bot on this box reads alerts.jsonl every minute and posts each one in
  #staff-updates, the channel whose id is in bot\staff-channel.txt
  (watch_services in bot\bot.py), writing its id to alerts-sent-bot.txt.
  When the bot is not running, or has not posted one within two and a half
  minutes, this posts it itself through a Discord webhook whose address is in
  alerts-webhook.txt in this folder on the VPS, and writes its id to
  alerts-sent-webhook.txt. That file is put there by -SetWebhook, never
  committed, never printed, never logged. With no webhook set, a message
  waits for the bot.

  The webhook has to be one made in #staff-updates, or the bot and the
  webhook say the same outages in two different channels. -SetWebhook asks
  Discord where a pasted webhook points and refuses any other channel, and
  the report this prints with no switch says where the one on the box points
  (#2501: until 12 Oct nothing checked, and the bot itself was saying the
  watchdog's messages in the dev updates channel).

  Anything else on this box that needs to tell staff something (the bot's own
  wrapper, issue #449) appends a line of the same shape to alerts.jsonl and
  this delivers it the same way. Watch-Outside.ps1, which asks from outside
  (issue #448), runs on GitHub's runners since #2755 and posts through the
  same webhook itself, because a runner cannot reach this box over ssh.
  tests\test-watch-alerts.ps1 drives the real
  code below against fakes: down, back, flapping, the bot down, a webhook
  that fails. bot\test-watch-services.py reads what that harness writes.

  What it checks:
    caddy     https://thornswood.net answers, which is the only one of these
              a visitor actually touches. Asked with the public name and its
              certificate on purpose: on 21 September Caddy was stopped for
              hours while node sat there answering 3001 perfectly, and a
              check of 3001 says everything is fine right through that.
              Asked of this box's own 443, not through the name, since the
              name is Cloudflare's (#2995) and Cloudflare answers 521 itself
              when Caddy is gone
    website   answers on 3001, which is what Caddy puts on 443
    game      answers on 3000, which is the resources the client pulls
    voice     answers on 7778
    bot       the python the ThornswoodBot service started is alive (#3189).
              And its heartbeat, C:\Thornswood-Bot\data\heartbeat.json, says it is on
              Discord: a bot hung or off Discord for ten minutes while its
              process runs is down too (issue #449). That file is written once
              Install-Bot.ps1 -NoToken has run. The bot is the Windows
              service ThornswoodBot (issue #465), so either way it is
              restarted by that name, under the same three an hour
    dev game  answers on 7788, the dev server's resources port
    dev voice answers on 7789
    bridge    answers on 7790, the ssh bridge (#2753), which is the only way
              into the box over ssh once port 22 takes no outside address
              (#2891). Down, it locks everybody out but the VNC console, so
              it is restarted like the rest
    disk      free space on C:, which every one of the above shares. Under
              twenty percent it writes DISK LOW, under ten DISK CRITICAL,
              once when the line is crossed and once when it comes back. It
              restarts nothing for it, because a restart frees nothing.

  And, told about but never restarted:
    health    the site, both game servers and both voice servers are also
              asked over HTTP, because a hung node process still accepts a
              connection (the kernel does that) and the port check above
              cannot tell hung from idle. That was the 18 September case.
    backup    the Thornswood Backup task's last result, and a backup file in
              C:\Thornswood-Backup less than 26 hours old
    offbox    the copy of the backups off this box is less than 26 hours
              old: the newest copy Fetch-Backups.ps1 on One has checked, by
              the name it writes into offbox.txt in this folder after each
              run (#2755). Judged here, not on One, so a One that is off is
              told about, since that is when the copy falls behind
    runner    every build runner's Windows service is running: the first,
              thornswood-vps, and the numbered ones Install-Runner.ps1
              -Number puts beside it (4 October)
    cert      the certificate Caddy holds for thornswood.net is accepted
              and has more than 14 days left. Caddy renews it about 30 days
              before the end, so under 14 is a renewal failing for two weeks.
              Watch-Outside.ps1 asked this until #2995; from outside it now
              sees Cloudflare's own certificate, and only this box can still
              reach Caddy's

  The two dev ones are here because the box has been watching them since 16
  September and this file did not know. vps-dev-instance.ps1, which runs ON
  the VPS, used to append them to the installed watch.ps1 in place. So the
  copy up there watched six things, the copy here watched four, and -Install
  would have written the shorter list over the longer one and taken the dev
  server and dev voice off the watchdog with nothing said. This list is the
  one place they live now: vps-dev-instance.ps1 writes nothing into watch.ps1
  and only says whether the installed one has them (issue #1106).

  The game's own traffic is UDP on 7777 and there is nothing to connect to, so
  3000 stands in for it. They are the same process, so if one is gone both are.
