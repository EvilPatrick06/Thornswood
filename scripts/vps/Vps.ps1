  Vps.ps1

  The one place every script gets the VPS address, user, and ports from.
  Dot-source it:

      . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot '..\vps\Vps.ps1')

  Then, after the param block:

      if (-not $User) { $User = Get-ThornswoodVpsUser }
      if (-not $Vps) { $Vps = Get-ThornswoodVpsAddress }

  An explicit -Vps or -User on the command line still wins, because the param
  keeps whatever was passed; only an empty default is filled from here.

  WHERE THE ANSWER COMES FROM, last one wins (issue #459):

    1. scripts\vps\vps.json, tracked, the box everybody uses.
    2. This machine's own file, never tracked:
       %LOCALAPPDATA%\Thornswood\vps.json, or the file THORNSWOOD_VPS_LOCAL
       names. Any field in it replaces the same field from the tracked one,
       so {"address": "203.0.113.9"} on its own points this machine at
       another box and keeps the rest.
    3. The environment: THORNSWOOD_VPS for the address, THORNSWOOD_VPS_USER
       for the user. For one shell or one scheduled task.

  So a machine that reaches the box by another address, or a new box being
  tried before Set-Vps.ps1 moves everybody, needs no edit to a tracked file.
  tests\test-vps-defaults.ps1 fails on the address written anywhere else in a
  script.

# ------------------------------------------------------ ssh and scp -----
# Every ssh, scp, ssh-keygen and ssh-keyscan a script runs goes through this:
#
#     $out = Invoke-ThornswoodNative { & ssh @ssh "$User@$Vps" $cmd } 2>&1
#     $wire | Invoke-ThornswoodNative { $input | & ssh @ssh $target $cmd } 2>&1
#
# so a line the program writes on stderr is never an error by itself, and
# whether it worked is its exit code ($LASTEXITCODE), the same in Windows
# PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7. Issue #941: from 28 September the box's
# OpenSSH (9.5) made the client here print "** WARNING: connection is not
# using a post-quantum key exchange algorithm" on stderr for every
# connection. Under Windows PowerShell 5.1 a native program's stderr line
# becomes an error record whenever stderr is redirected (2>&1, 2>$null, or a
# caller that redirected the whole script), and with $ErrorActionPreference
# = 'Stop', which every script here sets, the first one stops the script.
# PowerShell 7 never does that, which is why Ship still worked and
# Install-Voice.ps1 under powershell.exe did not.
#
# Inside this function the preference is Continue, for the call in the block
# and nothing else, so the stderr lines still come out as they always did: in
# the pipeline as error records under 2>&1 (Where-Object { $_ -is [string] }
# still drops them, [string]$_ still reads them), gone under 2>$null, and on
# the screen with no redirection. A real failure is still a failure: ssh and
# scp exit non-zero (255 when they cannot connect), and the caller reads
# $LASTEXITCODE as before. Keep the block to the one native call, so nothing
# else in a script is softened. tests\test-ssh-stderr.ps1 runs a stand-in ssh
# that prints the warning, under both PowerShells.
#
# A plain function on purpose: an advanced one (with [Parameter]) refuses
# pipeline input it has no parameter for, and the secret goes in by pipe.

# What goes into known_hosts is decided here: vps.json "hostKeys" holds the
# box's public host key fingerprints (SHA256), and a key is written only when
# the machine answering at the address shows one of them. A fingerprint is
# public: anybody who connects to port 22 is shown it. Read on 28 September
# with ssh-keyscan and matched against Patrick's known_hosts, which had held
# them since the box was set up.
#
# A rebuilt box has new keys. Put its fingerprints in vps.json (read them in
# the provider's console on the box itself: for each
# C:\ProgramData\ssh\ssh_host_*_key.pub, ssh-keygen -lf <file>), then
