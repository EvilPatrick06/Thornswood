  Restore-Server.ps1

  Puts a nightly backup's world back into a game server folder and checks the
  result would start: the load order resolves and the characters are there.

      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Server.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc -Root C:\Thornswood-Restore-Test
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Server.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc -Root C:\Thornswood-Server-Dev -Which dev
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Server.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc -Root <folder> -Expect 1234567
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Server.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc -Root <folder> -Work C:\Thornswood-Repo\temp\restore
      .\scripts\vps\Restore-Server.ps1 -Backup <file>.zip.enc -Root <throwaway folder> -Rehearse [-Port 7800 -VoicePort 7802]

  Restore-Backup.ps1 checks the signature and unpacks; this is the step after
  it that docs\RESTORING.md used to leave to hand copying. It takes the
  backup's game (live) or game-dev (dev) half and lays it into -Root:

    world    whole, because the backup is the truth about who exists
    private  whole: characters.json, mod-settings.json, take-limit.json,
             door.json, allowed.json. Nothing in a build ships into it.
    data     only the files the folder does not already have, so a build
             already installed there keeps its own shipped files
    server-settings.json and gamemode.js
             only when the folder has none, for the same reason, EXCEPT the
             keys that say which server this is: port, name,
             thornswoodVoicePort, thornswoodServer and
             thornswoodLoadOrderRefuse come from the backup. The payload on
             the box (C:\thornswood-server.zip) is whichever channel was
             published last, and on the first rehearsal (28 September) it was
             a dev one: a live restore kept port 7787 and the name
             Thornswood Dev, so the live server would have come back as the
             dev one. The join pass switch and the written role lists,
             thornswoodRequirePass, thornswoodDevs and thornswoodPlaytesters,
             come from the backup too (#1845): they are the server's own and
             no build carries them (#1223), so the payload's would be nobody's
             choice. Those three are named and their values never printed.

  Whatever world and private the folder already had is moved aside into
  world-before-restore-<stamp> inside it, never deleted.

  -Root must already hold the server program and its plugins: on a new box,
  Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 -Zip <payload> -Root <it> -NoTask first. The
  backup does not carry them; they come from the repo.

  THE LOAD ORDER CHECK. server-settings.json names each plugin by its full
  path, C:/Thornswood-Server/plugins/..., so a throwaway folder restored from
  a live backup would "resolve" against the live server's plugins and prove
  nothing. Any entry whose folder is not -Root is pointed at -Root first (the
  same rewrite vps-dev-instance.ps1 does for dev), and then every entry must
  be on disk. One that is not is named and the run ends with exit 1, the same
  refusal Install-ThornswoodServer.ps1 makes.

  THE CHARACTER CHECK. A character is a change form named with a bare number
  in world\changeForms (0.json, 1.json, ...: a slot number, not the profile
  id) whose profileId is set and which is not deleted. A deleted character
  keeps its slot file with profileId -1 and isDeleted true, so counting the
  files counted the dead too: the first real rehearsal, 28 September, found
  18 slot files on live and 11 people in them. No characters is exit 1.
  -Expect <profile id> (the number the launcher and the site show, in
  decimal) also requires that person's character.

  It refuses to touch a folder whose server is running: the server writes
  world while it runs and would write straight back over the restore.

  Prints RESTORE OK and exits 0 only when every check above passed.

  A REHEARSAL, -Rehearse (issue #1046). A restore makes the folder BE the
  server it came from: its port, its name and private\door.json, which names
  the live site and holds the key the site trusts and the join pass key. That
  is right for a real restore and wrong for a throwaway folder somebody means
  to start and connect to, and docs\RESTORING.md left making it safe to four
  hand steps nobody had done. -Rehearse does them after every check above has
  passed, and refuses before anything is put back when -Root is one of the
  server folders on this machine (C:\Thornswood-Server,
  C:\Thornswood-Server-Dev):
    ports    port and thornswoodVoicePort become free ones: the first game
             port from 7800 up whose UDP and TCP are free and whose resources
             port (port+1, what the server opens itself) is free on TCP, and
             the first free TCP port above that for voice. Never the live or
             dev ports, read from both server folders' settings and the
             backup's, nor 7777, 7778, 3000, 7787 or 7788. -Port and
             -VoicePort name them instead, checked the same way.
    door     private\door.json is deleted from the folder; the backup still
             holds it. Not moved: a moved copy of the site key is one more
             place a secret sits.
    pass     thornswoodRequirePass is set to false, said by name only: the
             join pass key is in door.json, so with the hold on nobody could
             stay connected. Start it only where its ports are not open to
             the internet.
    name     " (restore rehearsal)" goes on the end of name.
    record   rehearsal.json in the folder says when, from which backup, the
             ports, and what was taken out. Each -Rehearse is a whole new
             restore and writes it again.
  It prints REHEARSAL READY with the start line and the launcher settings.
  It never writes docs\RESTORING.md's Last rehearsed line: that waits for a
  person who started it and loaded a character.

  -Work is the folder the decrypted zip and the unpacked backup sit in while
  this runs. Left out, that is %TEMP%. Restore-Backup.ps1 is given the same
  folder, so the zip is not written to %TEMP% either. Both are deleted before
  this exits, including when the run is refused: the unpacked backup holds
  the bot token and the site keys.
