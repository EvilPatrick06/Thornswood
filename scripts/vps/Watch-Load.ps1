  Watch-Load.ps1

      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Load.ps1            bring the record down and say what it shows
      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Load.ps1 -Install   put the collector on the server
      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Load.ps1 -Remove    take it off again, leaving the record

  The website, the game server, the voice service and the bot share one five
  core box, and nothing kept a number for any of them. Check-Load.ps1 is a
  reading while you watch; Watch-Services.ps1 restarts what stops. Neither
  writes anything down, so there was no way to tell which of them a bigger box
  or a split would be for.

  -Install puts vps-load.ps1 on the box as C:\Thornswood-Watch\load.ps1 and a
  task that runs it every five minutes as SYSTEM. Each run appends one line to
  C:\Thornswood-Watch\load.csv: the box's CPU, memory, free disk and network
  bytes, the people on, and for each of the seven services the watchdog looks
  after, its processor time, memory and I/O. vps-load.ps1 says what each
  column is.

  With no switches this copies load.csv (and load.1.csv, if it has rolled)
  into logs\ here and runs Read-Load.ps1 on it, which says which service leads
  CPU, memory and I/O, and when the busiest hour was.

  Leave it a week that includes a busy evening before reading anything into
  it. What to do about the answer is for Patrick and Djinn in #staff-updates.

  The collector is its own task, not part of the watchdog, so it can never get
  in the way of a restart. -Remove takes the task off and leaves the record.
