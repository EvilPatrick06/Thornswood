  vps-say-staff.ps1

  Puts one staff notice from an agent into the watchdog's outbox,
  alerts.jsonl, which the bot says in #staff-updates within a minute, or the
  watchdog through its #staff-updates webhook when the bot is down (#447).
  It is the box's half of scripts\ops\Say-Staff.ps1 and runs ON the box, as
  C:\Thornswood-Watch\say-staff.ps1 beside the watchdog (Watch-Services.ps1
  -Install puts it there).
  So an agent posts a notice itself, through the bot, and no Discord token
  or webhook ever leaves the box (#2934).

  WHAT IT READS, on standard input, one line:
      say <the notice, UTF-8, base64>    queue it
      check <id>                         whether it has been said yet
      unsay <id>                         take it back (#3328): only the
                                         sender's own, by -From
      (nothing)                          prints READY and changes nothing,
                                         which is how a new key is proved
  The notice is never on a command line: sshd hands that to cmd.exe, and
  quotes and length go wrong there (Watch-Outside.ps1 says the same).

  WHAT IT ANSWERS, one line:
      QUEUED <id>        written to the outbox
      POSTED bot         the bot said it (its id is in alerts-sent-bot.txt)
      POSTED webhook     the watchdog's webhook said it
      WAITING            in the outbox, not said yet
      EXPIRED            in the outbox and over a day old, so never said
      NOT FOUND          no notice with that id
      UNSAY QUEUED <id>  the bot takes it back within a minute
      UNSAY WAITING      (check) asked to be taken back, not done yet
      UNSAID <what>      (check) taken back: deleted, gone (it was not
                         there any more), withheld (never said), webhook
                         (the watchdog's webhook said it; a person with
                         Manage Messages deletes it), unknown, or failed
                         and why, from the bot's data\staff-unsaid.txt
      NOWATCHER          the watchdog is not installed here, so nothing would
                         ever say it; nothing was written
      REFUSED <why>      nothing was written

  WHAT IT WRITES is one line of the outbox's own shape (id, at, service,
  kind, text), the shape Watch-Outside.ps1 and the watchdog write:
      id       agent-<from>-<yyyyMMddHHmmss UTC>-<6 hex>
      service  agent <from>
      kind     notice
      text     [<from>] <the notice>
  and nothing else, anywhere. <from> is one lower case word. On a key that
  Grant-BoxAccess.ps1 -NoticesOnly made, sshd runs this as the key's forced
  command with -From set to the key's own name, whatever the client asked
  to run, so a notices key can do this and nothing more: no shell, no file
  copy, no forwarding, and it cannot say it is somebody else.

  LIMITS, so a key that can only post cannot drown the channel either:
  1800 characters a notice (the bot cuts at 1900; the [<from>] goes in
  front), and 30 an hour for each <from>. Mentions are off in both the bot
  and the webhook, so @everyone in a notice is text.

  Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is what the box runs.
  tests\test-say-staff.ps1 runs this against a scratch folder.
