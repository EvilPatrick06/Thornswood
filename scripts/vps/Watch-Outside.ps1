  Watch-Outside.ps1

  Watches, from outside the VPS, the things the project needs that the VPS
  cannot watch for itself, and tells staff in Discord when one breaks and
  again when it is fixed.

      ./Watch-Outside.ps1                     look once and print it; remembers and posts nothing
      ./Watch-Outside.ps1 -Run -Folder state  one scheduled pass: remember, tell, post (what the workflow runs)
      ./Watch-Outside.ps1 -TestPost           post one test message through WATCH_WEBHOOK
      ./Watch-Outside.ps1 -Export <folder>    write the public repository's files into <folder>
      .\scripts\vps\Watch-Outside.ps1 -Remove take the old scheduled task off a Windows machine (One)

  WHY (issue #448). Watch-Services.ps1 runs on the VPS and watches the
  services there, and since #447 it tells staff when one dies. But a box
  cannot see itself die: when the whole VPS or its network goes, the watcher
  and the bot that posts for it go with it, and nothing says a word. So this
  runs somewhere else and asks what a stranger on the internet would see.

  WHERE IT RUNS (issue #2755, Patrick's option A on #2750, 19 Oct 2026). Until
  then it was a scheduled task on One, so it saw nothing while One was off.
  Now it runs on GitHub's Linux runners, under PowerShell 7, from a small
  public repository that holds only this script, its settings and the
  workflow (-Export writes them; scripts\vps\watch-outside\ holds the
  workflow and the README). Actions minutes on a public repository are not
  billed. It cannot run on the VPS runners, because it has to be off the box.
  After this script changes, run -Export into a clone of that repository and
  push it, or the runner keeps asking with the old copy.

  WHAT IT ASKS, measured from One on 28 September:
    site      https://thornswood.net/ answers over HTTPS with a certificate
              the runner accepts (200 in 213 ms that day). Two runs in a row
              before it counts, so one slow answer is not an outage.
    feed      https://thornswood.net/feed/version.json and feed-dev answer
              200 with a feed in them (a launcherUrl and the release record
              the launcher syncs from, baseline.id), and the launcher each one
              names answers its first byte. Since #1050 a feed carries no
              packs on purpose, so packs are not asked for. Every launcher
              reads these to update, and a new install starts from them. The
              addresses are Updater.cs's own.
    cert      the certificate on thornswood.net has more than 14 days left.
              Let's Encrypt (issuer YE2), 13 December 2026 that day, 75.8
              days. Caddy renews it about 30 days before, so under 14 means a
              renewal has been failing for two weeks.
    dns       thornswood.net resolves to the VPS in scripts\vps\vps.json and
              nothing else. The name servers are Cloudflare's (brenna and
              robert.ns.cloudflare.com) and the A record points straight at
              the VPS itself, not through Cloudflare's proxy. If
              the proxy is ever switched on, this is the line to change.
    domain    the registration has more than 30 days left, once a day.
              Registered 15 September 2026 through Cloudflare, runs out 15
              September 2027 (RDAP, rdap.org).
    runner    GitHub lists every build runner as online: thornswood-vps and
              the numbered ones beside it, thornswood-vps-2 and up
              (Install-Runner.ps1 -Number, 4 October). Asked over REST with
              WATCH_RUNNER_TOKEN, a fine-grained token that can only read the
              repository's runners (Administration: read on that one
              repository). With none online, no pull request gets Launcher
              builds and nothing may merge; with some, the checks wait
              longer. Three runs in a row, because a runner restarts itself
              when it updates.
    nexus     the Nexus collection still exists, once an hour. Nexus refuses
              a plain page request (403), but its public GraphQL answers a
              stranger: collection "Thornswood", revision 1, that day.

  What it no longer asks, since it left One: the copy of the backups off the
  VPS is judged by the watchdog on the box now, from what Fetch-Backups.ps1
  tells it after each copy it checks (Watch-Services.ps1 offbox), so it is
  told while One is off, which is when it falls behind. Code signing was
  asked with One's own az sign in, which a runner does not have; where it is
  asked now is Patrick's decision on #2755.

  Also measured and not asked on every run: the VPS is BisectHosting
  (NET-192-135-112-0-1, RDAP), which has no status page to ask, and the site
  check above is what notices the box going. Discord's API answered 200 in
  122 ms; it is the path the messages go out on, so there is nothing to tell
  anybody through when it is down. A message that cannot be posted waits and
  is tried again every run for a day.

  THREE OUTCOMES (issue #2857). A check says Ok, Wrong, or that it could not
  check. It could not check when the service it had to ask is not the thing
  it watches and did not answer, or refused: GitHub for the runners, the
  registry for the domain, the site's handshake for its certificate. On 19
  October One's own call to GitHub timed out and the message said the
  runners were down while all four were online. Could not check never counts
  as the thing being down and never resets an outage already told; it is
  watched on its own, and after about an hour of runs in a row (two runs for
  the hourly and daily checks) it is told once, as "the outside watcher
  cannot check ...", and once more when it can again. A token that ran out
  is told that way instead of never. Nothing is asked twice in a run: a
  retry would hide a real outage of the network it asks over.
  Where the service asked IS the thing watched (the site, the feeds, Nexus,
  the name), not answering is Wrong. That this runner is the one offline is
  ruled out first: when neither GitHub nor Discord answers, the run writes
  that and changes nothing, so a dropped connection is never an outage.

  HOW A PERSON IS TOLD: straight to #staff-updates through the Discord
  webhook in WATCH_WEBHOOK, a secret of the public repository: the same
  webhook the VPS watchdog keeps. No mentions, so nothing can ping anybody.
  The first run that finds something wrong (or the second or third, as above)
  writes ONE message saying what is wrong and when it was first noticed; the
  message saying it is fixed comes once it has been fine on two runs in a
  row, so a thing that flaps is one outage and two messages. Each message is
  a line in alerts.jsonl in the state folder (id, at, service, kind, text,
  the VPS outbox's shape; the ids start "outside-"), and one that Discord did
  not take is tried again every run for a day. A runner cannot reach the box
  over ssh, so these lines no longer reach the box's alerts.jsonl, and
  Read-Availability.ps1 reads the box's own caddy check for the site.

  WHERE ITS MEMORY LIVES. A runner starts empty every time, so what is down,
  when each hourly check was last asked, the outbox and what was posted live
  in the -Folder the workflow keeps in the Actions cache: restored at the
  start of a run from the newest one, saved under a new key at the end. Not
  in a commit, because a commit to a public repository is public and the
  messages name private things (the runners), and not as an artifact, which
  anybody can download. Fork pull requests' workflows could read the cache,
  which is why the repository needs approval for every outside
  contributor's workflow (its README says so).

  THE RUN LOG IS PUBLIC. Everything -Run prints says only what anybody can
  already see: the site, feeds, certificate, name, registration and the
  collection are public, and for the runners (a private repository's) it
  prints only the outcome, never a name, a count or the reason. The secrets
  are never printed (GitHub masks them too), and a message's text goes only
  to Discord, never to the log.
