  Bot-Service.ps1

  Runs the Thornswood bot as a Windows service under its own account, and
  stops and starts it by name (issue #465). Functions only, run ON the VPS as
  Administrator: Install-Bot.ps1 sends this in front of its own script, the
  way it sends Write-BotToken.ps1.

      Install-ThornswoodBotService   build the service program, put the
                                     service in place of the old loop, grant
                                     its account what the bot reads and
                                     writes, start it by name
      Restart-ThornswoodBotService   stop by name, sweep, start by name
      Repair-ThornswoodBotData       the folder the service writes its log
                                     and records in, there and writable by
                                     its account, for a restart on a box
                                     where it has gone
      Get-ThornswoodServiceSid       NT SERVICE\<name>'s SID, before the
                                     service exists (sc.exe showsid agrees)

  WHY. The bot ran as SYSTEM, every right on the box that holds every secret,
  for a program that decodes images people upload (the join card) and talks to
  Discord all day. It ran under run.ps1, a PowerShell loop in the scheduled
  task 'Thornswood Bot', and nothing stopped it by name: stopping the task left
  python running, so every script that restarted the bot killed python by its
  command line, and the watchdog could not restart a hung bot at all.

  NOW. The service ThornswoodBot runs BotService.cs (built here, on the box,
  by the .NET Framework's csc), which runs python bot.py and rolls bot.log by
  size while it runs. Its account is NT SERVICE\ThornswoodBot, a virtual
  account Windows makes for the service: it has no password, so there is
  nothing to keep, rotate or send (Send-Secret.ps1 has nothing to carry), and
  it is nobody's but the bot's. It keeps one privilege, the one for walking
  folders, like the site's account (Deploy-Docs.ps1 -RunAs), because the
  impersonation right every service gets by default is the usual way from a
  service account to SYSTEM. Its rights on files are granted below and are
  the bot's own folder plus what bot.py reads, measured in bot.py on 29 Sep.

  tests\test-bot-service.ps1 runs these functions here, against stand-ins for
  the service manager and against scratch folders with the real icacls.

#     rule reaches it (every service account is in Users), and OWNER RIGHTS
#     is held to read and run, so a file the account made before this and
#     still owns cannot have its rules changed by it.
#   data\ under it, Modify: bot.log and its rolls, heartbeat.json,
#     joins.json, open-tickets.json and commands-synced.json. The one place
#     the account writes.
#   service\ under it, read only and not inherited from the folder, so the
#     account cannot change the program or host.json that start it.
#   webhooks\ under it, nothing: SYSTEM and Administrators only. The news
#     and dev webhooks are read over ssh by the machines that ship, never by
#     the bot.
#   bot.env.json, read. It is protected (Install-Bot), so this is the one
#     rule on it besides SYSTEM and Administrators.
#   the watchdog's folder, read on the files in it (alerts.jsonl, what the
#     webhook already posted), and Modify on alerts-sent-bot.txt, the one file
#     there the bot writes. The webhook's own file is protected and stays out
#     of reach.
#   the site's data\for-bot, read (issue #1102): trouble.json, inbox.json and
#     moderation.log, which the site writes there for the bot and nothing
#     else. The rule the bot had on the site's whole data folder before, where
#     sessions.json and the other records are, is taken off.
#   each game server's for-bot folder, read on it and everything in it
#     (issue #2321): the gamemode's staff log, moderation.log, which the
#     bot says in the staff channel. A folder, made here when the server has
#     none yet, so the log the gamemode makes later takes the rule. Until
#     #2321 the rule was on private\moderation.log itself, which could only
#     be given once the gamemode had made the file; the live server had
#     none, so its first staff action made a file the bot could not open.
