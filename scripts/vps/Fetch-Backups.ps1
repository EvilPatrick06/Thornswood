  Fetch-Backups.ps1

  Brings the nightly backups off the VPS onto this machine, and checks that
  what arrived is readable. This is the half that makes them backups: a copy
  that only exists on the server is gone with the server.

      .\scripts\vps\Fetch-Backups.ps1              bring down anything new
      .\scripts\vps\Fetch-Backups.ps1 -All         bring down everything, again
      .\scripts\vps\Fetch-Backups.ps1 -NoVerify    just copy, do not open them

  EVERY ONE IT BRINGS DOWN IS CHECKED (issue #2200), with Restore-Backup.ps1
  -CheckOnly, not just the newest: a newest-only check says nothing about the
  others. Each file is named with its result. One that fails, or arrives
  short, is renamed out of the backup pattern to <name>.failed-<stamp>, kept
  for a look and never counted, pruned or skipped as already here, and the
  run ends non-zero. No passphrase, or no Restore-Backup.ps1 beside this
  script, is a failure too, because then nothing was checked. -NoVerify is the
  one way to skip the check, and says so.

  Everything it brings down is encrypted, so where it lands matters less than
  it would otherwise. The passphrase is the thing to keep carefully, and it is
  not in here.

  WHERE THEY LAND: local\backups in the repository (Where.ps1 Backups), or
  the folder -To names. Until 5 October it was Downloads\Thornswood-Backups;
  Patrick's rule that day is that Thornswood work on One lives only in the
  repository and the vault (and C:\ThornswoodTemps&Worktrees, inside the
  repository since #2900). A worktree's local
  folder goes when the worktree is removed, so run from a worktree it stops
  and asks for -To rather than land there.

  ON ITS OWN, since issue #401:

      .\scripts\vps\Fetch-Backups.ps1 -Schedule      every day at 04:15, an hour after the box takes one
      .\scripts\vps\Fetch-Backups.ps1 -Unschedule    take that task off again
      .\scripts\vps\Fetch-Backups.ps1 -PruneOnly     only the tidy below, no ssh

  -Schedule copies this script, Restore-Backup.ps1, Vps.ps1 and vps.json to
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Thornswood\Backups-Fetch and points a task on this machine at
  that copy, so the task does not break when a repo folder or worktree is
  moved or removed. The task is given -To as a whole path, the folder this run
  would use, because the copy has no Where.ps1 beside it to ask; a -To or
  -KeyFile that is not a whole path (C:\... or \\server\share) is refused
  before anything is made or registered (#2199). It runs as
  you, while you are signed in, and a run missed because the machine was off
  happens at the next sign in. Run -Schedule again after this script changes
  to refresh the copy, and after the backups folder moves so the task writes
  to the new one.

  The copy off the box goes over ssh (scp), with the key already used for the
  VPS. Nothing is ever served over HTTPS for this.

  KEPT HERE: everything from the last -KeepDays days (30 unless told), and the
  newest seven whatever their age, so a VPS that stopped taking backups a
  month ago does not quietly lose its last good ones here too. Only files
  named the way the box names them are ever considered.

  Every run adds to fetch.log in the -To folder, because a task that runs
  unattended says nothing to anybody otherwise.
